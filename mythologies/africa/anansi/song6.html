    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Cat Eyes in the Thicket" takes you deep into the heart of the jungle where Anansi, the trickster god, faces off against the mighty leopard — a symbol of raw power and speed. But in this heavy, intense metal track, it's Anansi’s cunning that prevails over brute force.</p>
<p>This song captures the tension between predator and prey, as Anansi uses his wit to defeat the swift and deadly leopard. With each twist and turn of the story, Anansi lures the leopard into a trap, using silence, patience, and strategy. The jungle comes alive with pounding drums, heavy guitars, and the relentless rhythm of Anansi’s scheming. The track paints a vivid picture of Anansi’s trickery and triumph, blending both the primal energy of the jungle and the sharp intelligence of the spider god.</p>
<p>Rooted in Ashanti and Akan mythology, "Cat Eyes in the Thicket" is a testament to Anansi’s eternal role as a master trickster who always finds a way to outsmart even the most dangerous beasts. It’s a battle of wits and might — and Anansi emerges victorious, proving once again that brains triumph over brawn.</p>

Cat Eyes in the thicket

The jungle roars, the night is near,
The leopard prowls, the prey to fear.
With eyes of gold and fangs that gleam,
It stalks the shadows in the dream.

But Anansi knows the game is set,
A master’s plan, a clever bet.
In silence deep, the trap is laid,
The mighty hunter will be swayed.

Cat eyes in the thicket, a hunter's pride,
But Anansi’s web will turn the tide.
With a twist, the story bends,
The trap is sprung, the game ends.

The leopard leaps, a flash of light,
Its claws so sharp, its strength in sight.
But Anansi waits with patient grace,
A spider’s web, a trickster’s chase.

But Anansi knows the game is set,
A master’s plan, a clever bet.
In silence deep, the trap is laid,
The mighty hunter will be swayed.

Cat eyes in the thicket, a hunter's pride,
But Anansi’s web will turn the tide.
With a twist, the story bends,
The trap is sprung, the game ends.

Through the shadows, the leopard falls,
Anansi’s laughter, the jungle calls.
A trap well-set, a game well-played,
The hunter caught, the spider’s made.

Now the leopard lies, its pride undone,
Anansi’s work is never done.
With clever hands and sharper mind,
The web he spins, the world confined.

But Anansi knows the game is set,
A master’s plan, a clever bet.
In silence deep, the trap is laid,
The mighty hunter will be swayed.

Cat eyes in the thicket, a hunter's pride,
But Anansi’s web will turn the tide.
With a twist, the story bends,
The trap is sprung, the game ends.
