    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>In this heavy, myth-driven metal anthem, Anansi – the spider god and master of fate – weaves the very fabric of the universe. The song explores his origins in Ashanti mythology as the creator who spun the threads of life, the cosmos, and the stories that bind them together. From the darkness of the void, Anansi’s clever hands trace the design of the world, manipulating fate with every strand he spins.</p>
<p>This track is a powerful blend of raw energy, storytelling, and heavy riffs, representing Anansi’s ability to shape existence itself. With his cunning and wit, he outwits gods and forges the world from chaos. A true embodiment of the trickster archetype, Anansi teaches us that knowledge and fate are not given — they must be crafted with skill, guile, and wisdom.</p>

Weaver of Worlds

From the dark, the web was spun,
Threads of fate, no end, no sun.
He weaves the world in shadows deep,
A spider’s dance, a secret keep.

Through the void, his hands shall trace,
Binding realms with silent grace.
Spinning life with every strand,
The Weaver of worlds, at his command.

Weaver of worlds, weaves the night,
In the silence, he brings the light.
Across the cosmos, webbed in strands,
Fate’s design is in his hands.

The stars are born from his embrace,
The winds will follow, find their place.
Through webs that hold the earth and sky,
Anansi spins, and gods must try.

In every thread, a story told,
The myths unfold, the truths of old.
Silent hands, they twist and bind,
A trickster’s art, the fate entwined.

Weaver of worlds, weaves the night,
In the silence, he brings the light.
Across the cosmos, webbed in strands,
Fate’s design is in his hands.

From chaos, order’s thread is found,
A whispered call, without a sound.
Weaving life from threads of night,
The world is born in spider’s flight.

And when the final strand is spun,
The web will hold, the dance is done.
Anansi’s work, it ever stands,
The weaver’s hand, the world commands.

Through the void, his hands shall trace,
Binding realms with silent grace.
Spinning life with every strand,
The Weaver of worlds, at his command.

Weaver of worlds, weaves the night,
In the silence, he brings the light.
Across the cosmos, webbed in strands,
Fate’s design is in his hands.
