    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
The First Labor of Hercules was to slay the Nemean Lion, a monstrous beast with impenetrable skin that terrorized the land of Nemea. No weapon could pierce its hide, so Hercules had to strangle it with his bare hands after trapping it in a cave. After killing the lion, he skinned it using its own claws and wore its pelt as an invincible cloak, which became one of his most iconic symbols. This labor was the first of twelve tasks assigned to him by King Eurystheus as punishment for his past sins. 🦁🔥

    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
🔥 Beast of Nemea 🔥
      
Through valley deep, where shadows crawl,
A beast awaits—no blade shall fall.
The gods decree, my fate is sworn,
To slay the beast, to stand reborn.

"Mortal hands shall break like sand,
No forged steel shall strike it down."
"Face the beast, embrace your fate,
Only strength shall wear the crown."

🔥 Roar of thunder, teeth like spears,
Face the lion, crush your fears!
No sword shall cut, no blade shall tear,
Strike with hands and strip despair! 🔥

Foolish man, you tempt the grave,
No hero stands, no soul I save.
Fangs like daggers, death my throne,
Your bones will rest beneath my stone.

Strike and break, yet none shall land,
This beast defies my mortal hand!
Breath of fire, eyes of night,
I grip its throat, I crush its might!

🔥 Roar of thunder, teeth like spears,
Face the lion, crush your fears!
No sword shall cut, no blade shall tear,
Strike with hands and strip despair! 🔥

"He stands alone, the beast lies still,
A lion's skin, his strength, his will."
"Through trials ten, his fate is drawn,
The legend grows, the tale lives on..."
