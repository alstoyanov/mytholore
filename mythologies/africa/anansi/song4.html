    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Hornet Trap" brings to life one of Anansi's most cunning feats, as the legendary trickster god uses wit and cleverness to trap a swarm of hornets and win his ultimate prize — the stories of the world.</p>
<p>In this fierce and fast-paced track, Anansi sets a clever trap for the hornets, tricking them into a pot where they are sealed inside, unable to escape. As the storm rages around them, the hornets fall into the trap, and Anansi claims victory once again through his unmatched cunning. This metal anthem channels the energy of the storm, the buzzing fury of the hornets, and Anansi’s perfect strategy. With explosive riffs and a relentless beat, "Hornet Trap" captures the thrill of outsmarting even the most dangerous creatures.</p>
<p>The song draws from Ashanti and Akan mythology, where Anansi’s cleverness knows no bounds. He demonstrates the power of strategy and intelligence over brute force, showing that even the most formidable challenges can be overcome with a well-laid plan.</p>

Hornet trap

The storm is rising, the wind is wild,
Anansi grins, his heart beguiled.
With a pot and a story to spin,
The hornets swarm, the trap begins.

He calls to the wind, he whispers low,
A pot for shelter, where they’ll go.
He seals them in with a clever trick,
The hornets trapped, too slow, too quick.

Hornet trap, in the storm’s embrace,
Anansi’s web, they can't escape.
Buzzing fury, trapped inside,
The spider wins with cunning pride.

The hornets rage, they feel the lie,
But Anansi’s smile, it never dies.
He weaves his web with silent grace,
The trap is set, no escape, no trace.

He calls to the wind, he whispers low,
A pot for shelter, where they’ll go.
He seals them in with a clever trick,
The hornets trapped, too slow, too quick.

Hornet trap, in the storm’s embrace,
Anansi’s web, they can't escape.
Buzzing fury, trapped inside,
The spider wins with cunning pride.

In the stillness, the storm subsides,
The hornets trapped, their fury hides.
Anansi laughs, the deal is done,
The stories are his, the battle won.

Now the hornets buzz, their fury ceased,
Anansi's trick, a masterpiece.
With a smile, he claims his prize,
The world’s stories, his to devise.

He calls to the wind, he whispers low,
A pot for shelter, where they’ll go.
He seals them in with a clever trick,
The hornets trapped, too slow, too quick.

Hornet trap, in the storm’s embrace,
Anansi’s web, they can't escape.
Buzzing fury, trapped inside,
The spider wins with cunning pride.
