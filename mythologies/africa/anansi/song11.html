    <h2>Story</h2>
 <p>"The Lion’s Share" is a powerful, energetic track that tells the story of Anansi’s cunning victory over the mighty lion, one of the fiercest creatures in the jungle. The song captures Anansi’s cleverness and his ability to outsmart the strongest of foes, using nothing but his intelligence and wit.</p>
<p>In this song, Anansi faces the lion — a symbol of raw power and brute strength. But through his trickery, Anansi turns the tables, claiming the lion’s strength as his own. The music blends heavy guitar riffs and pounding rhythms with moments of tension and triumph, reflecting the battle of wit versus might. The victory over the lion is not just a win over one creature, but a representation of intelligence triumphing over strength.</p>
<p>Inspired by Ashanti and Akan mythology, "The Lion’s Share" embodies Anansi’s role as the trickster god who uses guile and wisdom to conquer overwhelming odds. It’s a reminder that even the mightiest can fall, and the cleverest will always find a way to win.</p>

The Lion’s Share

In the jungle, the lion roars,
His strength unmatched, his power soars.
He challenges all, the kings and beasts,
But Anansi’s web will never cease.

The lion’s pride is in his grasp,
But Anansi knows how to outlast.
A trick, a twist, a clever plan,
The lion’s pride, it starts to bend.

The lion’s share, it’s his to take,
Anansi spins, the world will shake.
Strength and might will bow to mind,
The lion falls, the webs unwind.

The lion growls, he paces fast,
He doesn’t know his fate is cast.
Anansi waits, with patience keen,
A twist of fate, the trap is seen.

The lion’s pride is in his grasp,
But Anansi knows how to outlast.
A trick, a twist, a clever plan,
The lion’s pride, it starts to bend.

The lion’s share, it’s his to take,
Anansi spins, the world will shake.
Strength and might will bow to mind,
The lion falls, the webs unwind.

The trap is set, the lion falls,
Anansi’s web, the victory calls.
The strength is gone, the lion kneels,
Anansi’s wit, the world reveals.

Now the lion lies in quiet shame,
Anansi claims his rightful fame.
For wit and wisdom, the greatest prize,
Outshines the might of all who rise.

The lion’s pride is in his grasp,
But Anansi knows how to outlast.
A trick, a twist, a clever plan,
The lion’s pride, it starts to bend.

The lion’s share, it’s his to take,
Anansi spins, the world will shake.
Strength and might will bow to mind,
The lion falls, the webs unwind.
