    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>This heavy-hitting metal track brings to life the legendary Anansi — a master manipulator, a weaver of webs, and a cunning trickster who outwits gods, kings, and all who dare cross his path. With every beat and riff, Anansi is on the hunt, spinning his web of lies and deceit with the precision of a spider, all while laughing in the face of those who underestimate him.</p>
<p>Inspired by the rich Ashanti and Akan myths, "Eight-Legged Schemer" encapsulates the essence of Anansi’s mischievous nature, his ability to turn the tables with a few clever words, and his never-ending dance with fate. The track channels the essence of his trickster power, blending brutal guitar riffs and rhythmic beats with the cunning and stealth of Anansi's world-spanning webs.</p>
<p>Anansi’s legacy endures in tales where brains, not brawn, conquer the day — and this track celebrates the eternal trickster who bends reality, one thread at a time. Whether you’re into metal, myth, or powerful storytelling, "Eight-Legged Schemer" is sure to leave you tangled in its web.</p>

Eight-Legged Schemer

In the shadows, he makes his move,
A mind of cunning, a heart that proves.
Spinning lies with his silken thread,
The spider's path, where gods have fled.

Deceit is his, the trickster's art,
He plays the game, a master’s heart.
With every step, he builds his scheme,
The eight-legged schemer, a trickster's dream.

Eight-legged schemer, in the dark,
A web of lies, a striking mark.
With every twist, the truth undone,
Anansi’s game has just begun.

He walks through realms, a whisper’s call,
The mighty bow, the mighty fall.
Fools are led with every thread,
The hunter becomes the hunted instead.

Deceit is his, the trickster's art,
He plays the game, a master’s heart.
With every step, he builds his scheme,
The eight-legged schemer, a trickster's dream.

Eight-legged schemer, in the dark,
A web of lies, a striking mark.
With every twist, the truth undone,
Anansi’s game has just begun.

A thread, a snare, the world entwined,
In every lie, the truth he finds.
He spins the world in webs of gold,
A story told, a truth retold.

Through the gods, through earth and sky,
He laughs aloud as the strong deny.
Anansi’s web, the fate of kings,
A spider’s dance, the trickster sings.

Deceit is his, the trickster's art,
He plays the game, a master’s heart.
With every step, he builds his scheme,
The eight-legged schemer, a trickster's dream.

Eight-legged schemer, in the dark,
A web of lies, a striking mark.
With every twist, the truth undone,
Anansi’s game has just begun.
