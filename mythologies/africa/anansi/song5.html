    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Fangs and Wisdom" is an electrifying metal track inspired by one of Anansi's greatest victories in African folklore — his cunning defeat of the mighty python.</p>
<p>In this powerful anthem, Anansi faces off against the serpent, using his wit and wisdom to defeat a creature of unimaginable strength. As the python strikes with its deadly fangs, Anansi spins a web of lies and tricks that leads the serpent into a trap. The music captures the tension, danger, and eventual triumph of the trickster god, blending powerful guitar riffs and pounding drums to represent Anansi's intelligence triumphing over brute strength.</p>
<p>Drawing from the Ashanti and Akan myths, "Fangs and Wisdom" celebrates the age-old message that intellect and wisdom often win the day against overwhelming force. Anansi’s story of defeating the python is one of cunning over brawn, a tale that shows how brains, not brawn, make a true hero.</p>

Fangs and wisdom

The serpent strikes, its fangs so bright,
A twist of fate, a dangerous bite.
But Anansi grins with quiet grace,
A plan unfolds, the time and place.

With every coil, the danger grows,
But in his mind, the answer shows.
A clever trick, a tangled lie,
The serpent’s power, the spider's eye.

Fangs and wisdom, clash of might,
Anansi’s web, the serpent’s fight.
With every twist, the tale unspins,
The trap is set, the spider wins.

The python thrashes, mighty and strong,
But Anansi hums his secret song.
He weaves a tale, a trick divine,
The serpent’s pride, a fatal sign.

With every coil, the danger grows,
But in his mind, the answer shows.
A clever trick, a tangled lie,
The serpent’s power, the spider's eye.

Fangs and wisdom, clash of might,
Anansi’s web, the serpent’s fight.
With every twist, the tale unspins,
The trap is set, the spider wins.

The fangs fall still, the trap is tight,
Anansi laughs, the world alight.
From wisdom’s hand, the battle’s done,
The stories won, the trap has spun.

Now the python lies, a defeated king,
Anansi’s plan, the song he sings.
With webs of wisdom, tales unfold,
The stories grow, the truth is told.

With every coil, the danger grows,
But in his mind, the answer shows.
A clever trick, a tangled lie,
The serpent’s power, the spider's eye.

Fangs and wisdom, clash of might,
Anansi’s web, the serpent’s fight.
With every twist, the tale unspins,
The trap is set, the spider wins.
