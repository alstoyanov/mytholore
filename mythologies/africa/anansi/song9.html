    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"The Calabash of Secrets" is a tale of wisdom, deceit, and revelation, told through the eyes of Anansi, the cunning trickster god. In this track, Anansi attempts to hoard the wisdom of the world in a calabash, keeping it hidden away from all. But as he tries to conceal the secrets, he learns that wisdom cannot be contained or kept — it must be shared.</p>
<p>The music flows through moments of tension and release, mirroring Anansi’s struggle to hold onto the wisdom that is destined to spread across the world. With pounding rhythms and intricate melodies, "The Calabash of Secrets" captures Anansi’s inner conflict and the eventual flood of knowledge that escapes his grasp. The song embodies both the weight of knowledge and the inevitable truth that wisdom cannot be hoarded forever.</p>
<p>Inspired by Ashanti and Akan mythology, "The Calabash of Secrets" is a reminder that knowledge is a force that belongs to everyone — and that trying to keep it locked away only leads to chaos. Anansi’s plan backfires as the calabash of secrets spills over and spreads, changing the world forever.</p>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
The Calabash of secrets

In the dark, he holds the prize,
A calabash of secret skies.
Anansi’s hands, they gently grip,
The knowledge vast, the wisdom’s tip.

But wisdom’s weight is heavy, bound,
A treasure locked, where none can sound.
Anansi grins, he hides it tight,
The world’s true light, away from sight.

The calabash of secrets, in the dark,
Anansi’s grip, a hidden spark.
The world awaits the tale untold,
But wisdom’s truth, he cannot hold.

He climbs the tree, the branches high,
To hide the truth beyond the sky.
A lie to hold, a dream to keep,
The wisdom’s locked in shadows deep.

But wisdom’s weight is heavy, bound,
A treasure locked, where none can sound.
Anansi grins, he hides it tight,
The world’s true light, away from sight.

The calabash of secrets, in the dark,
Anansi’s grip, a hidden spark.
The world awaits the tale untold,
But wisdom’s truth, he cannot hold.

The wisdom spills, a river flows,
The secret leaks, the world now knows.
Anansi laughs, a twist, a change,
The calabash, it’s now estranged.

Now the world has seen the light,
The wisdom freed, the truth in sight.
Anansi’s smile, a lesson learned,
The calabash, its secrets burned.

But wisdom’s weight is heavy, bound,
A treasure locked, where none can sound.
Anansi grins, he hides it tight,
The world’s true light, away from sight.

The calabash of secrets, in the dark,
Anansi’s grip, a hidden spark.
The world awaits the tale untold,
But wisdom’s truth, he cannot hold.
