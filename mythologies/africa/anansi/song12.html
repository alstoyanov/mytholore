Storyteller eternal

Through the ages, his tale’s been told,
A weaver’s mind, a thread of gold.
Anansi spins, from dawn to dusk,
The world is born, the truth in trust.

A web of stories, woven tight,
The spider’s thread, the gods' delight.
From the dark, the world begins,
The storyteller’s hand spins.

Storyteller eternal, his voice will rise,
A tale untold beneath the skies.
Through every word, the world is spun,
Anansi’s work is never done.

Through the storms and shadows deep,
Anansi’s words, they never sleep.
A trickster’s mind, a god’s own hand,
He weaves the world, across the land.

A web of stories, woven tight,
The spider’s thread, the gods' delight.
From the dark, the world begins,
The storyteller’s hand spins.

Storyteller eternal, his voice will rise,
A tale untold beneath the skies.
Through every word, the world is spun,
Anansi’s work is never done.

Through every age, his web will grow,
The stories told, the wisdom flow.
In every heart, in every mind,
Anansi’s tales are intertwined.

Now the world is made anew,
Through every tale, the spirit grew.
Anansi laughs, the circle turns,
The eternal flame, it brightly burns.

A web of stories, woven tight,
The spider’s thread, the gods' delight.
From the dark, the world begins,
The storyteller’s hand spins.

Storyteller eternal, his voice will rise,
A tale untold beneath the skies.
Through every word, the world is spun,
Anansi’s work is never done.
