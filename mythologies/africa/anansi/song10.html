    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"The Feast of Fools" is a high-energy metal track that brings to life the legendary story of Anansi, the trickster god, as he attends a grand feast with the gods — and turns the tables on them with his cunning wit.</p>
<p>In this song, Anansi is invited to the gods' banquet, where they mock him for his small size and perceived weakness. But Anansi, ever the trickster, uses his intelligence and deception to win the gods' respect and gain the upper hand. As he feigns hunger and plays the fool, the gods fall for his clever tricks and are outsmarted at their own feast. The music captures Anansi’s strategic mind, the tension of the gods’ mockery, and his eventual triumph.</p>
<p>Rooted in Ashanti and Akan mythology, "The Feast of Fools" celebrates Anansi’s cleverness and resilience. This track embodies the eternal trickster who proves that wit and guile can defeat strength and pride, turning even the gods into his pawns. A reminder that in the world of myth, it’s not always the strongest who win — but the most cunning.</p>

The Feast of fools

The gods prepare a feast of gold,
A banquet bright, a tale unfolds.
They mock the spider, weak and small,
But Anansi smiles, he’ll fool them all.

He hears their laughter, feels their scorn,
A plan is born, a trick is sworn.
With every word, he plays his part,
A feast of fools, he’ll win their hearts.

At the feast of fools, they laugh and dine,
Anansi’s web, the truth will shine.
He spins the lies, he bends the game,
The gods are fooled, and none will blame.

They offer him the food to taste,
But Anansi knows they’ll make him waste.
He feigns a hunger, plays the fool,
The gods believe, they think he’s ruled.

He hears their laughter, feels their scorn,
A plan is born, a trick is sworn.
With every word, he plays his part,
A feast of fools, he’ll win their hearts.

At the feast of fools, they laugh and dine,
Anansi’s web, the truth will shine.
He spins the lies, he bends the game,
The gods are fooled, and none will blame.

The table’s set, the gods are blind,
Anansi’s words, they twist and wind.
He plays the game, the tricks are sweet,
The feast is his, the gods defeat.

The gods now bow, their pride undone,
Anansi’s feast, his victory won.
They serve him drinks, they raise his name,
The trickster god, the gods’ own shame.

He hears their laughter, feels their scorn,
A plan is born, a trick is sworn.
With every word, he plays his part,
A feast of fools, he’ll win their hearts.

At the feast of fools, they laugh and dine,
Anansi’s web, the truth will shine.
He spins the lies, he bends the game,
The gods are fooled, and none will blame.
