    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Echoes of Uaithne" is a haunting, atmospheric track that delves into the legendary tale of Dagda’s enchanted harp. Named Uaithne, this mystical instrument held the power to sway emotions, bend time, and influence the very course of fate. The song reflects the resonating echoes of the harp’s ancient songs—the Song of Sleep, the Song of Sorrow, and the Song of Battle—woven into a timeless melody that transcends the ages.</p>
<p>In a world where magic and music intertwine, "Echoes of Uaithne" captures the sorrowful, powerful legacy of the harp, whose strings have been played across the battlefields of Ireland, its music both a weapon and a balm. With its ethereal atmosphere, shifting between dark and light, the track immerses listeners in the mythic past of the Tuatha Dé Danann and their struggle against the Fomorians.</p>

Echoes of Uaithne

Strings of fire, forged in gold,
A song of ages, fierce and old.
A whisper carried on the wind,
A tale of sorrow, war, and sin.

Its voice still lingers in the air,
A melody beyond despair.

Sing, oh harp, the tale of kings,
Through shattered lands, your voice still rings.
A song of sorrow, a song of war,
A song of life forevermore.

The hands of gods, the touch of fate,
A gift of power none could break.
Yet stolen deep in shadowed halls,
Its silence weeps as darkness falls.

Its voice still lingers in the air,
A melody beyond despair.

Sing, oh harp, the tale of kings,
Through shattered lands, your voice still rings.
A song of sorrow, a song of war,
A song of life forevermore.

Through every age, the echoes call,
No time will break the harp’s enthrall.

Let silence fade, let voices rise,
A thousand souls beneath the skies.
The harp awakens, chords resound,
The gods return, the lost is found.

Its voice still lingers in the air,
A melody beyond despair.

Sing, oh harp, the tale of kings,
Through shattered lands, your voice still rings.
A song of sorrow, a song of war,
A song of life forevermore.

When dust remains and all is gone,
The song will rise, forever strong.
