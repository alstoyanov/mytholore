    <h2>Story</h2>
</p>"Resonance Eternal" is the final breath of a mythic journey—an epilogue echoing across time, where the power of Dagda’s harp, Uaithne, lingers far beyond the last battle, the last king, and even the last breath of gods. This song draws from the deeply rooted belief in Celtic mythology that memory, music, and magic are immortal—that the stories of the Tuatha Dé Danann live on, not just in myth, but in the very air of the world.</p>
</p>In the wake of victory, as the battlefield stills and the divine warriors fade into legend, Uaithne plays one final melody—subtle, eternal, and filled with the weight of everything that came before. Its song threads through the veil that separates the mortal world from the Otherworld, binding fate and memory together in a sacred harmony that cannot be forgotten.</p>
</p>"Resonance Eternal" honors the idea that myth never truly ends. The harp’s notes become part of the wind, the stars, the stones. The legacy of the gods, their music, their sorrow, and their triumphs, becomes woven into the world’s foundation. Those who listen closely may still hear its call—gentle, distant, and eternal.</p>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
Resonance Eternal

The winds are silent, the stars align,
A whispered tale, a fading sign.
The harp now plays, its notes are light,
A song that fades into the night.

Through time and space, the echoes fall,
A story told, a hero’s call.

Resonance eternal, the song of old,
A legend whispered, a tale untold.
Through the veil, the echoes fly,
The harp’s last note beneath the sky.

The strings they hum, the air is still,
A final breath, the world stands still.
The guitar weaves, the harp does sing,
The end has come, the bell does ring.

Through time and space, the echoes fall,
A story told, a hero’s call.

Resonance eternal, the song of old,
A legend whispered, a tale untold.
Through the veil, the echoes fly,
The harp’s last note beneath the sky.

As shadows fade and daylight wanes,
The legend calls, it still remains.
In every heart, in every mind,
The resonance lives, forever binds.

Through time and space, the echoes fall,
A story told, a hero’s call.

Resonance eternal, the song of old,
A legend whispered, a tale untold.
Through the veil, the echoes fly,
The harp’s last note beneath the sky.

And as the strings fade, a memory stirs,
The tale lives on, in the wind’s soft purr.
Resonance eternal, the song of fate,
The legend endures, never to abate.
