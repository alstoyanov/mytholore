    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Cloaked in Shadow, Bound by Steel" is a dark, war-charged anthem rooted in the ancient conflict between the Tuatha Dé Danann and the Fomorians, two mythical forces locked in a battle for Ireland’s fate. This song tells of the warriors who fought in secrecy, hidden by magic and clad in enchanted steel, as they prepared to strike against the monstrous Fomorian oppressors.</p>
<p>In the dead of night, beneath a storm-choked sky, the hidden warriors of the Tuatha move like specters through the battlefield—shrouded in shadow, their blades glinting with the power of the gods. Bound by destiny, their weapons forged from Otherworldly fire, they strike with unyielding purpose, knowing that the fate of their people rests upon their steel.</p>
<p>Dagda’s harp whispers its ancient song, guiding their hands, while Lugh, the warrior of light, leads them into the chaos of war. Blades clash, magic crackles in the air, and the battle for sovereignty rages on. The Fomorians, cursed and wrathful, fight to reclaim what they believe is theirs, but the Tuatha Dé Danann stand unbroken.</p>
<p>"Cloaked in Shadow, Bound by Steel" is a song of war, fate, and sacrifice, bringing to life the shadowed warriors of Irish myth—those who fought not for glory, but for the survival of their kind.</p>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
Cloaked in Shadow, Bound by Steel

Footsteps silent in the night,
Shadows dance in silver light.
Blades are drawn, no words are spoken,
Through halls of stone where fate is broken.

One wrong move, the hunt begins,
A silent war no one wins.

Cloaked in shadow, bound by steel,
A fate unbroken, hearts of will.
The harp lies waiting, lost and cold,
A voice imprisoned, a story untold.

The air is thick with whispered lies,
Echoes tracing where danger hides.
Through corridors of endless dread,
A single path where angels tread.

One wrong move, the hunt begins,
A silent war no one wins.

Cloaked in shadow, bound by steel,
A fate unbroken, hearts of will.
The harp lies waiting, lost and cold,
A voice imprisoned, a story untold.

The strings still hum in dreams of old,
Their song returns, their fate unfolds.

One wrong move, the hunt begins,
A silent war no one wins.

Cloaked in shadow, bound by steel,
A fate unbroken, hearts of will.
The harp lies waiting, lost and cold,
A voice imprisoned, a story untold.

The chamber stands in eerie glow,
A final breath, the time moves slow.
The hand extends, the strings ignite,
The song of gods reclaims the night.

One wrong move, the hunt begins,
A silent war no one wins.

Cloaked in shadow, bound by steel,
A fate unbroken, hearts of will.
The harp lies waiting, lost and cold,
A voice imprisoned, a story untold.

Through fire and stone, the path was true,
The dawn is near, the harp sings new.
