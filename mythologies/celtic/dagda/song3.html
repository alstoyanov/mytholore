    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"The Fomorian Curse" is a dark and haunting anthem, weaving a tale of vengeance, sorrow, and the rise of the monstrous Fomorians. Born from the depths of the sea and cursed by fate, these ancient beings are driven by a malevolent force, their whispers crawling beneath the waves, forever bound to their tragic destiny.</p>
<p>With a doom-laden atmosphere that builds to crushing intensity, the song tells of the Fomoriansâ€™ quest to claim the powerful harp and unleash their wrath upon the gods and the world. As shadows rise under crimson skies and blades of darkness are drawn, the battle between fate and vengeance unfolds.</p>
<p>The pounding rhythm and brooding melodies evoke a sense of hopelessness and fury, with every note carrying the weight of a kingdom shattered and a world denied. The Fomorians' curse remains, and as their voices wail through the shattered skies, the world trembles on the brink of destruction.</p>

The Fomorian Curse

From the depths of the sea they rise,
Shadows born under crimson skies.
Cursed by fire, cursed by fate,
Bound in hatred, forged in hate.

Their whispers crawl beneath the waves,
A song of sorrow, bound as slaves.

Bound by the curse, lost to the deep,
Through blood and ruin, their vengeance speaks.
A silent wail, a hollow cry,
A storm of sorrow, a world denied.

Blades of darkness, eyes of flame,
They seek the harp to end their shame.
A kingdom shattered, a price to pay,
The gods will tremble on this day.

Their whispers crawl beneath the waves,
A song of sorrow, bound as slaves.

Bound by the curse, lost to the deep,
Through blood and ruin, their vengeance speaks.
A silent wail, a hollow cry,
A storm of sorrow, a world denied.

The tide is turning, the sky is torn,
The gods will fall, the world will mourn.

Their whispers crawl beneath the waves,
A song of sorrow, bound as slaves.

Bound by the curse, lost to the deep,
Through blood and ruin, their vengeance speaks.
A silent wail, a hollow cry,
A storm of sorrow, a world denied.

The waves still whisper, the winds still moan,
Their curse remains, their fate unknown.
