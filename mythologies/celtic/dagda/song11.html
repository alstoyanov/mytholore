    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Harp of the Gods, Sword of the King" is a triumphant retelling of the Tuatha Dé Danann’s victory over the Fomorians, marking the rise of a divine kingship and the reclaiming of ancient power. Rooted in the mythology of Ireland, this song honors both the mystical and the martial—the sacred harp of Dagda, and the legendary sword wielded by the rightful king.</p>
<p>In Celtic legend, Dagda’s harp, Uaithne, was not only a source of unmatched magical power—it was a symbol of sovereignty, wisdom, and the divine harmony that bound the land and its rulers. Alongside this sacred instrument stood the champions of the Tuatha Dé Danann, such as Lugh and Nuada of the Silver Hand, whose weapons were blessed by the gods and whose courage shaped the fate of Ireland.</p>
<p>This song celebrates the moment after the Second Battle of Mag Tuired, when darkness is driven back, the Fomorians are defeated, and the harp resounds across the land once more. The sword is raised not in conquest, but in renewal. The harp sings not of sorrow, but of strength reborn. It is a coronation hymn, echoing through time to proclaim that balance has been restored, and the gods walk again with their people.</p>
<p>"Harp of the Gods, Sword of the King" is the mythic heartbeat of a world reforged—where music and might rule together, and the echoes of victory become legend.</p>

Harp of the Gods, Sword of the King

The battle’s done, the war is won,
The dawn has broken, the fight is won.
The gods have called, the king stands tall,
The Tuatha rise, they heed the call.

The winds of fate have shifted now,
The sword is raised, the king’s vow.

Harp of the gods, the strings resound,
With every note, the earth shakes the ground.
Sword of the king, the victory’s true,
The realm is ours, the world anew!

Through fire and blood, through endless night,
The gods have led us to the light.
With strength and pride, we took our stand,
The power of the Tuatha’s hand.

The winds of fate have shifted now,
The sword is raised, the king’s vow.

Harp of the gods, the strings resound,
With every note, the earth shakes the ground.
Sword of the king, the victory’s true,
The realm is ours, the world anew!

And with the harp, we shape the sky,
The battle’s song, the eagle’s cry.
The sword of kings, the heart of gods,
We stand victorious, we’ll never fall.

The winds of fate have shifted now,
The sword is raised, the king’s vow.

Harp of the gods, the strings resound,
With every note, the earth shakes the ground.
Sword of the king, the victory’s true,
The realm is ours, the world anew!

The victory’s ours, the sun has set,
The reign of the gods, no more regret.
The king ascends, the crown is earned,
The future calls, the world will turn.

The winds of fate have shifted now,
The sword is raised, the king’s vow.

Harp of the gods, the strings resound,
With every note, the earth shakes the ground.
Sword of the king, the victory’s true,
The realm is ours, the world anew!

The harp will play, the king will reign,
The Tuatha rise, no more in vain.
Harp of the gods, sword of the king,
The future calls, the angels sing.
