    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"The Harbinger’s Lament" is a chilling narrative sung from the perspective of Balor, the fearsome and tragic king of the Fomorians—a race of dark, elemental beings in Irish mythology. Known as Balor of the Evil Eye, he was a harbinger of destruction whose very gaze could kill, and whose destiny was sealed by prophecy: that he would one day be slain by his own grandson.</p>
<p>This song explores Balor’s inner reckoning as he foresees the fall of his people and his own impending death in the Second Battle of Mag Tuired. Despite his monstrous power, Balor is not portrayed as mindless or purely evil—instead, he is a ruler haunted by fate, aware that the doom of the Fomorians has already begun to unfold. His lament is not one of weakness, but of inevitability, as he watches the signs align and the storm of battle approach.</p>
<p>In Irish myth, it is Lugh, grandson of Balor and champion of the Tuatha Dé Danann, who ultimately strikes him down, fulfilling the prophecy. This moment represents not only the end of a tyrant, but a turning point in mythic history, where the old, chaotic powers give way to a new age of divine order and wisdom.</p>

The Harbinger’s Lament

The winds are changing, the storm is near,
A shadow stirs, a deepened fear.
My eye, once strong, now blind with dread,
The future calls for those long dead.

The signs are clear, the omen's true,
The fates have come to see me through.

I hear the cry, I see the flame,
The end of all, the fall of name.
The harbinger calls, yet none can hear,
The doom that waits, the future near.

The drums of war, they call my name,
But in my heart, it’s all the same.
The tide will turn, the blood will flow,
And in my death, the winds will blow.

The signs are clear, the omen's true,
The fates have come to see me through.

I hear the cry, I see the flame,
The end of all, the fall of name.
The harbinger calls, yet none can hear,
The doom that waits, the future near.

I felt the light, I saw the spear,
A child’s hand will bring me here.
In my death, the world will rise,
My doom comes swift, I hear the cries.

The signs are clear, the omen's true,
The fates have come to see me through.

I hear the cry, I see the flame,
The end of all, the fall of name.
The harbinger calls, yet none can hear,
The doom that waits, the future near.

I see the end, it waits for me,
My blood will stain the endless sea.
And when I fall, the world will weep,
My legacy, a promise deep.

The signs are clear, the omen's true,
The fates have come to see me through.

I hear the cry, I see the flame,
The end of all, the fall of name.
The harbinger calls, yet none can hear,
The doom that waits, the future near.

The eye is closed, the doom complete,
A king must die, the world must weep.
The harbinger’s song, it fills the night,
And in my death, the dawn will rise.
