    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Call of the Ancient Strings" is a powerful and mystical hymn to Dagda’s enchanted harp, Uaithne, an instrument of divine origin that resonates through the ages. In Celtic mythology, this legendary harp was not merely an instrument—it was a force of nature, woven with the very fabric of fate itself.</p>
<p>Crafted in the Otherworld, Uaithne held the power to shape the emotions of all who heard it. With a single strum, Dagda could summon the Song of Sleep, lulling entire armies into slumber; the Song of Sorrow, bringing even the mightiest warriors to their knees in grief; and the Song of Battle, igniting fury in the hearts of the Tuatha Dé Danann as they fought against their foes.</p>
<p>This song tells of the moment when Dagda lifts his harp in the heat of war, calling forth its magic to turn the tide of battle. As the ancient strings echo through the battlefield, the power of the gods is unleashed, binding the fates of mortals and immortals alike. The Fomorian invaders, monstrous and relentless, tremble as the harp’s voice commands the forces of destiny.</p>
<p>"Call of the Ancient Strings" is an epic tribute to Celtic legend, the power of music, and the unbreakable will of the Tuatha Dé Danann. The echoes of Uaithne still resound through time—will you heed the call?</p>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
Call of the Ancient Strings

From mist and shadow, deep and wide,
A voice awakens, long denied.
The hands of fate, the chords unseen,
Now rise again where gods have been.

A whisper rolls across the land,
The echoes stir, the silence stands.

Call of the ancient strings resounds,
Through time and fire, through lost and found.
A melody of fate untold,
A song of power, bright and bold.

The stars align, the earth now sighs,
As spirits wake with glowing eyes.
The song once lost now rides the air,
Its sound too vast for man to bear.

A whisper rolls across the land,
The echoes stir, the silence stands.

Call of the ancient strings resounds,
Through time and fire, through lost and found.
A melody of fate untold,
A song of power, bright and bold.

No mortal hand can break the tune,
No king can bend its voice in ruin.

A whisper rolls across the land,
The echoes stir, the silence stands.

Call of the ancient strings resounds,
Through time and fire, through lost and found.
A melody of fate untold,
A song of power, bright and bold.

Through storm and stone, through war and peace,
Its sound remains, it never sleeps.
And when the world begins to fall,
The harp will play the end of all.

A whisper rolls across the land,
The echoes stir, the silence stands.

Call of the ancient strings resounds,
Through time and fire, through lost and found.
A melody of fate untold,
A song of power, bright and bold.

Still it sings beyond the night,
A voice eternal, burning bright.
