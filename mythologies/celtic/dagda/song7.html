    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>In the myths of the Tuatha Dé Danann, the Harp of Dagda was not merely an instrument, but a force of divine emotion. When the Song of Sorrow was played, it was said to bring the battlefield to silence, and even the fiercest of enemies would feel the full weight of their losses. This hymn is a reflection of that moment—a remembrance of fallen heroes, forgotten vows, and love lost to the tide of time.</p>
<p>As the shadows fall and the stars weep, "Hymn of Sorrow" becomes a sacred elegy for those left behind. It is the voice of the harp whispering across the veil between worlds, a timeless mourning sung not only for the dead, but for the legends they became.</p>

Hymn of Sorrow

Beneath the moon, the shadows fall,
A silent cry, a mourning call.
The world once bright now fades to grey,
As sorrow sings its endless way.

The tears of gods, the tears of men,
A song of loss that will not end.

Hymn of sorrow, hymn of night,
A song that calls the soul’s plight.
Through endless pain, through endless tears,
The harp still plays the song of fears.

The hands that wept, the hearts that bled,
Are echoes now of words unsaid.
Each string that rings a cry unheard,
A voice of anguish, a final word.

The tears of gods, the tears of men,
A song of loss that will not end.

Hymn of sorrow, hymn of night,
A song that calls the soul’s plight.
Through endless pain, through endless tears,
The harp still plays the song of fears.

It sings of hearts that once were whole,
Now torn apart, a blackened soul.
No solace found, no peace, no light,
Just endless sorrow through the night.

The tears of gods, the tears of men,
A song of loss that will not end.

Hymn of sorrow, hymn of night,
A song that calls the soul’s plight.
Through endless pain, through endless tears,
The harp still plays the song of fears.

And when the dawn refuses rise,
The world remains with tear-stained skies.
The harp will play, though none may hear,
A hymn of sorrow, a song of fear.

The tears of gods, the tears of men,
A song of loss that will not end.

Hymn of sorrow, hymn of night,
A song that calls the soul’s plight.
Through endless pain, through endless tears,
The harp still plays the song of fears.

Through the silence, through the grief,
The harp will play, though none find relief.
