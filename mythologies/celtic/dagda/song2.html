    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Tuatha Rising" is a thunderous battle anthem inspired by the mythic warriors of the Tuatha Dé Danann, the divine race of Ireland who waged war against the monstrous Fomorians. As the drums of war echo through the land, the Tuatha gather under the banners of their gods, preparing for the Second Battle of Mag Tuired, a legendary conflict that would decide the fate of Ireland.</p>
<p>Led by their mighty champions—Dagda, Lugh, and Nuada of the Silver Hand—the Tuatha Dé Danann rise from the shadows, answering destiny’s call. With swords of light, spells of ancient power, and the enchanted harp of Dagda, they march toward war, determined to reclaim their homeland from the Fomorian oppressors.</p>
<p>"Tuatha Rising" channels the raw energy of Celtic myth, weaving a tale of gods, warriors, and fate. This song embodies the spirit of defiance, the power of magic, and the unbreakable will of the Tuatha Dé Danann, whose legend still echoes through the ages.</p>
<p>Raise your weapons, heed the call, and witness the rise of the Tuatha!</p>

Tuatha Rising

Steel and fire, the storm ignites,
Marching forward into endless night.
Swords are ringing, banners high,
For Tuatha’s name, we stand or die.

Through blood and war, our fate is sealed,
No chains can break the strength we wield.

For Tuatha rising, the battle calls,
Through storm and thunder, we break the walls.
By fate unshaken, by blood we stand,
The harp will guide the warrior’s hand.

The drums of war will shake the sky,
As Fomor’s horde comes rushing by.
Blades of shadow, hearts of stone,
They seek to claim the harp’s lost throne.

Through blood and war, our fate is sealed,
No chains can break the strength we wield.

For Tuatha rising, the battle calls,
Through storm and thunder, we break the walls.
By fate unshaken, by blood we stand,
The harp will guide the warrior’s hand.

The gods are watching, the tide is high,
One final stand beneath the sky.
A thousand voices, one last cry,
For Tuatha’s name, we will not die.

Through blood and war, our fate is sealed,
No chains can break the strength we wield.

For Tuatha rising, the battle calls,
Through storm and thunder, we break the walls.
By fate unshaken, by blood we stand,
The harp will guide the warrior’s hand.

The echoes fade but still remain,
A kingdom forged through war and pain.
