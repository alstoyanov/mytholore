    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Across the Stormy Seas is the third epic chapter in our mythological metal saga, The Quest for the Golden Fleece. This track captures the perilous journey of Jason and the Argonauts as they sail through raging tempests, facing the wrath of Poseidon and the merciless sea.</p>
    <p>Thunderous drums and crashing guitars echo the fury of the ocean, while haunting melodies invoke the struggle between mortals and gods. Inspired by ancient Greek mythology, this song tells the tale of a crew bound by fate, their courage tested against forces beyond their control.</p>

Across the Stormy Seas

Winds arise, the heavens roar,
Waves like titans pound the shore,
Thunder calls the gods’ decree,
No turning back, no sanctuary.

Lightning cracks, the mast will break,
Tides of doom, the sea gods wake!

Across the stormy seas we ride,
Through wrath and fury, side by side,
The Fates may tear the sky apart,
But fire still burns within our hearts!

Poseidon's wrath, a raging tide,
No safe harbor, nowhere to hide,
Darkened waters pull us low,
The stars above refuse to glow.

Lightning cracks, the mast will break,
Tides of doom, the sea gods wake!

Across the stormy seas we ride,
Through wrath and fury, side by side,
The Fates may tear the sky apart,
But fire still burns within our hearts!

A guiding voice through wind and rain,
Orpheus sings to calm the pain,
Through shattered waves we rise again,
The gods may test, but we remain!

The sky is torn, the ocean wide,
The gods may cast their hate and pride,
But heroes sail where mortals fall,
The storm will break—we heed the call!

Across the stormy seas we ride,
Through wrath and fury, side by side,
The Fates may tear the sky apart,
But fire still burns within our hearts!

But heroes sail where mortals fall,
The storm will break—we heed the call!
