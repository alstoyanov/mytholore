    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Enter the battlefield of legend! The Field of Dragon Teeth tells the epic story of Jason, the hero tasked with plowing a cursed field and sowing the teeth of a dragon—only to face an army of undead warriors. With the aid of the sorceress Medea, Jason turns the army against itself, proving that not all battles are won with steel, but with wit and magic.</p>
    <p>This symphonic metal anthem blends thunderous riffs, orchestral intensity, and haunting melodies into a powerful retelling of one of the most legendary Greek myths. Featuring a duet between Medea and Jason, the song captures the tension between brutal combat and mystical strategy, where love, war, and fate collide.</p>

The Field of Dragon Teeth

Blade in hand, the plow cuts deep,
The soil drinks blood, the earth won’t sleep.
A hero’s task, a test of might,
Yet shadows whisper in the night.

Drink this fire, let fate obey,
My magic shields, your soul won’t sway.
But tread with care, for death will rise,
Born from the teeth, with hollow eyes.

Steel and bone, they march to fight,
A thousand warriors, bathed in night.

Ash and embers, rise and fall,
The field of war will heed my call.
Strike the ground, let chaos reign,
And watch the dead be bound in chains!

(Jason): From dust and fire, the bones ignite,
(Medea): But not all wars are won with might.
(Jason): Their hollow eyes, they seek my breath,
(Medea): Then turn their blades, let them bring death!

Steel and bone, they march to fight,
A thousand warriors, bathed in night.

Ash and embers, rise and fall,
The field of war will heed my call.
Strike the ground, let chaos reign,
And watch the dead be bound in chains!
[Bridge (Male & Female Duet - Haunting, Ethereal Section)]

Shadows dance, the Fates unwind,
A war not fought with sword, but mind.
The dragon’s curse now claims its own,
The earth reclaims what once was stone.

Ash and embers, rise and fall,
The field of war will heed my call.
Strike the ground, let chaos reign,
And watch the dead be bound in chains!

The dragon’s curse now claims its own,
The earth reclaims what once was stone.
