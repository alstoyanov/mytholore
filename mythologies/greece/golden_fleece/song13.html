    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
      This is the epic finale to the saga of Jason and the Argonauts—The Curse of the Fleece! In this powerful male-female duet, Jason and Medea face the inescapable doom brought upon them by the Golden Fleece. What was meant to be a symbol of power becomes their undoing, as the gods reveal that no mortal can wield such a gift without suffering.

The Curse of the Fleece

I sailed through fire, I bled through storms,
For golden light, for gods’ reward.
Yet now it whispers, dark and cold,
A fate foretold, a lie retold.

You took its glow, but can’t break free,
The fleece was never yours to keep!

The curse of kings, the weight of time,
Bound in gold, yet damned divine.
No throne can stand, no love can be,
When fate has marked eternity!

I warned of blood, I called the signs,
A hero’s tale is never kind.
The gods have laughed, the fates have spun,
Now Jason, see what you have done.

I held the prize, I claimed the sky,
But all I love must burn and die!

The curse of kings, the weight of time,
Bound in gold, yet damned divine.
No throne can stand, no love can be,
When fate has marked eternity!

(Jason): The fleece still gleams, but love is gone,
(Medea): The price was paid, the gods have won.
(Jason): A hero’s name will fade to dust,
(Medea): And so will all you ever trust.

A golden thread, a poisoned chain,
No hero’s hands escape the pain.
The gods decide, we played their game,
The fleece remains—our souls are claimed!

The curse of kings, the weight of time,
Bound in gold, yet damned divine.
No throne can stand, no love can be,
When fate has marked eternity!

The gods decide, we played their game,
The fleece remains—our souls are claimed!
