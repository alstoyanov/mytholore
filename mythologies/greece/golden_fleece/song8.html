    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The Bull of Bronze is a blazing metal anthem recounting Jason’s first trial in Colchis. To prove himself worthy of the Golden Fleece, Jason must tame the monstrous, fire-breathing bulls—beasts forged by Hephaestus himself. With steel hooves that shatter the earth and flames that reduce men to ash, the bulls are an unstoppable force of divine fury.</p>
    <p>With thunderous drums, blistering guitar solos, and primal vocals, this track captures the raw power and intensity of Jason’s battle against the beast. With only Medea’s dark sorcery to aid him, will Jason control the raging inferno, or be consumed by its wrath?</p>

    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
The Bull of Bronze

From the forge of gods it rose,
Built of iron, fire, and woe.
A titan forged in Hades’ breath,
One wrong step, a fiery death.

Steel hooves crash, the earth will break,
Flames will burn, no soul escapes!

The Bull of Bronze, a raging pyre,
Breathing death, a beast of fire.
Smoke and thunder, ground turns red,
Stand and fight or join the dead!

Eyes like embers, searing bright,
A beast of wrath, a god’s delight.
Jason stands, his fate is tried,
Will he tame or will he die?

Steel hooves crash, the earth will break,
Flames will burn, no soul escapes!

The Bull of Bronze, a raging pyre,
Breathing death, a beast of fire.
Smoke and thunder, ground turns red,
Stand and fight or join the dead!

Medea whispers, shadows dance,
A sorceress’ spell, his final chance.
Chains of magic, forged in dark,
Will the beast still bear its mark?

A hero’s grip, a fate untold,
Hands of steel on horns of gold.
One last breath, one final stand,
The Bull will fall, the gods demand!

The Bull of Bronze, a raging pyre,
Breathing death, a beast of fire.
Smoke and thunder, ground turns red,
Stand and fight or join the dead!

One last breath, one final stand,
The Bull will fall, the gods demand!
    </pre>
