    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Enter the epic heart of Greek legend with The Trials of Colchis! This song tells the moment Jason arrives in Colchis, the land of the Golden Fleece, and stands before the ruthless King Aeëtes. But the prize will not be handed over so easily. Instead, Jason must face three impossible trials:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🔥 Taming the Fire-Breathing Bulls – Beasts forged by Hephaestus himself, their hooves of bronze and breath of flame ready to incinerate any who dare approach.</li>
      <li>⚔️ Sowing the Dragon’s Teeth – Each tooth planted in the cursed soil will summon an army of undead warriors, bound to destroy the one who disturbs their slumber.</li>
      <li>🐍 The Ever-Watchful Serpent – A monstrous guardian, coiled around the fleece, its eyes never closing, its fangs dripping venom.</li>
    </ul>

The Trials of Colchis

Through the mist, the Argo sails,
Shadows whisper, fate unveils.
Colchis rises, fierce and grand,
A kingdom ruled by iron hand.

Gold and fire, blood and stone,
No foreign king shall take our throne.
Stranger's voice, a hollow claim,
Only trials earn his name!

I stand before the crimson king,
A prize to claim, a war to bring.

🔥 Steel and fire, test my soul,
Face the beasts that none control!
Plow the earth with hooves of flame,
Battle death to stake my name!
The gods decide, the fates decree,
Will the fleece belong to me? 🔥

"Bull of bronze with breath of fire,
Harness strength or face the pyre!
Teeth of dragons sown in dust,
Warriors rise, betray their trust!"

No chains of fear shall bind my hands,
The gods have carved my fate in sands.

🔥 Steel and fire, test my soul,
Face the beasts that none control!
Plow the earth with hooves of flame,
Battle death to stake my name!
The gods decide, the fates decree,
Will the fleece belong to me? 🔥

Dark coils slither, eyes that gleam,
A sleepless watcher haunts my dream.
The final beast, the golden glow,
A trial only death shall know...

🔥 Steel and fire, test my soul,
Face the beasts that none control!
Plow the earth with hooves of flame,
Battle death to stake my name!
The gods decide, the fates decree,
The Golden Fleece shall bow to me! 🔥

The gods decide, the fates decree,
The Golden Fleece shall bow to me!
