    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The Prophecy (Intro) is the haunting opening track to our concept album, The Quest for the Golden Fleece. This symphonic metal masterpiece draws inspiration from ancient Greek mythology, setting the stage for the epic tale of Jason and his legendary quest to obtain the Golden Fleece.</p>
    <p>The song introduces the prophecy that will guide Jason’s journey, delivered through sweeping orchestral melodies and powerful vocals. As the stars themselves seem to dictate the hero’s fate, the track serves as a foreboding call to adventure, setting the tone for the challenges, betrayals, and divine interventions that will follow.</p>

The Prophecy

Beneath the heavens, dark and wide,
A whisper stirs the winds that glide,
A future carved in stone and flame,
The gods will call a hero's name.

The prophecy is written in the stars,
A tale of glory, forged in wars,
Jason, chosen, must embrace his fate,
To claim the fleece, before it's too late.

The winds of fate begin to churn,
A silent flame that burns,
The gods above, they watch, they wait,
A hero stands at heaven’s gate.

The prophecy is written in the stars,
A tale of glory, forged in wars,
Jason, chosen, must embrace his fate,
To claim the fleece, before it's too late.

Through trials of gods, he'll rise or fall,
A voice will guide him, through it all,
To claim the prize, to break the chain,
The path is set, no turning again.

The prophecy is written in the stars,
A tale of glory, forged in wars,
Jason, chosen, must embrace his fate,
To claim the fleece, before it's too late.
