    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
      The Return to Iolcus is an epic metal anthem telling the final chapter of Jason’s quest. After braving the perils of Colchis, stealing the Golden Fleece, and defying gods and kings, Jason returns home—only to find that victory is never without consequence. His home is not as he left it, and the throne he seeks is one built on betrayal, blood, and divine wrath.

The Return to Iolcus

Through raging tides and crimson war,
The Argo sails to home once more.
A hero’s crown, a kingdom’s claim,
But fate has carved another name.

Blood will spill, the gods will see,
Victory never comes for free!

The banners rise, the echoes call,
Jason stands to take it all.
But shadows whisper, fate is grim,
A throne won’t bow—it swallows him!

Once a prince with golden dreams,
Now a king of shattered schemes.
The halls are dark, the walls decay,
No triumph here, just debts to pay.

Blood will spill, the gods will see,
Victory never comes for free!

The banners rise, the echoes call,
Jason stands to take it all.
But shadows whisper, fate is grim,
A throne won’t bow—it swallows him!

The Fleece still gleams, but hope is lost,
The gods have turned, the sea runs frost.
A hero’s tale is never clean,
Glory fades where ghosts still scream.

No crown will rest where curses dwell,
The road to power leads through hell.
His name will stand, his fate will fall,
Was it worth the cost at all?

The banners rise, the echoes call,
Jason stands to take it all.
But shadows whisper, fate is grim,
A throne won’t bow—it swallows him!

His name will stand, his fate will fall,
Was it worth the cost at all?
