    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The Harpies’ Wrath is the next furious chapter in our mythological metal epic, The Quest for the Golden Fleece. This track tells the tale of Jason and the Argonauts encountering the cursed king Phineus, tormented by the monstrous Harpies—ravenous creatures sent by the gods to steal his every meal, leaving him in endless suffering.</p>
    <p>With relentless drums, shredding guitars, and piercing vocals, this song embodies the chaos of the winged furies as they descend from the heavens to unleash destruction. The Argonauts stand their ground, but only divine intervention can break the curse.</p>

The Harpies' Wrath

Dark wings tear the ashen sky,
Screeching vengeance, curses fly,
Claws of shadow, eyes of flame,
None escape, none remain.

Foul winds rise, the sky turns black,
Once they strike, there’s no way back!

The Harpies’ wrath, a storm untamed,
Tearing flesh and screaming names,
A hunger deep, a curse unchained,
The gods have spoken—feel their pain!

Feast denied, their talons crave,
Plague and torment, none are saved,
Winged demons haunt the waves,
Doomed to suffer, doomed to stay.

Foul winds rise, the sky turns black,
Once they strike, there’s no way back!

The Harpies’ wrath, a storm untamed,
Tearing flesh and screaming names,
A hunger deep, a curse unchained,
The gods have spoken—feel their pain!

Jason stands, blade in hand,
Fighting storms that scar the land,
But only gods can break the chains,
Mortal strength will be in vain.

Thunder rolls, the sky ignites,
A voice commands, the harpies’ flight,
A hero's plea, a fate restored,
But still they haunt the ocean’s roar!

The Harpies’ wrath, a storm untamed,
Tearing flesh and screaming names,
A hunger deep, a curse unchained,
The gods have spoken—feel their pain!
