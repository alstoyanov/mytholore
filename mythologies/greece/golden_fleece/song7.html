Trials of the Heart

In the shadows, I watched you come,
A hero searching for what’s undone.
Your eyes were bright, your heart was bold,
But fate was cruel, the tale untold.
I see the strength within your soul,
But there’s a path you must control.
The trials ahead, you must survive,
Or the Golden Fleece will stay alive.

You speak of trials, a twisted fate,
But in your eyes, I feel no hate.

Through fire and blood, you must stand tall,
Beneath the gods, who watch it all.
I’ll help you through, this journey dark,
Together, we will leave our mark.

The bulls that breathe with fire and flame,
You must tame them, or be the same.
A field of warriors, born of stone,
With my magic, you won’t stand alone.
The dragon sleeps, his eyes closed tight,
But with my gift, you’ll win the fight.
My heart is torn, but still, I’ll stand,
To guide your fate with my own hand.

Your love and power bind me tight,
But will it bring me through the night?

Through fire and blood, you must stand tall,
Beneath the gods, who watch it all.
I’ll help you through, this journey dark,
Together, we will leave our mark.

(Male - Jason): I came for glory, I came for gold,
(Female - Medea): But love is the price you’ll pay, I’m told.
(Male - Jason): What is this spell that binds us here?
(Female - Medea): It’s magic, and love, entwined with fear.
[Bridge (Male & Female Duet)]

I’ll give you my heart, I’ll give you my soul,
I’ll stand beside you, to make you whole.
These trials are ours, to face and fight,
In love and magic, we will unite.

Through fire and blood, you must stand tall,
Beneath the gods, who watch it all.
I’ll help you through, this journey dark,
Together, we will leave our mark.
