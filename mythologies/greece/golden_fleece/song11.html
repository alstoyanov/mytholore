Medea’s betrayals

Whispers in the wind, a love undone,
Vows once sacred, now fade with the sun.
I bled for you, I burned for your crown,
Now my name is cursed, cast down.

Oaths were broken, hearts set free,
Tell me, Jason, did you ever love me?

Medea’s wrath, a love betrayed,
Shattered vows in fire and blade.
Winds will howl, the gods will see,
No man walks away from me!

You swore to me beneath the stars,
Now she holds you in her arms.
A wedding feast, a golden throne,
Was I just a stepping stone?

Oaths were broken, hearts set free,
Tell me, Jason, did you ever love me?

Medea’s wrath, a love betrayed,
Shattered vows in fire and blade.
Winds will howl, the gods will see,
No man walks away from me!

A poisoned gift, a final breath,
A crown now forged in grief and death.
You took my heart, you took my trust,
Now all you love will turn to dust.

Darkened skies, the Fates have spun,
Vengeance speaks—what’s done is done.
I was your goddess, now hear my cry,
You broke my heart, now watch love die!

Medea’s wrath, a love betrayed,
Shattered vows in fire and blade.
Winds will howl, the gods will see,
No man walks away from me!

I was your goddess, now hear my cry,
You broke my heart, now watch love die!
