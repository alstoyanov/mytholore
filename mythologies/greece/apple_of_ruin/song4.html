    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>As Paris prepares to judge between the goddesses, Athena, goddess of strategic war and divine intellect, offers him a gift unlike any other: eternal victory. She promises wisdom in combat, foresight in council, and unmatched dominance through clarity and thought.</p>
    <p>Unlike the others, she offers no kingdom, no seduction. Instead, she offers understanding, strategy, and the power to control fate itself through reason.</p>
    <p>This track is Athena’s voice—measured, brilliant, and fierce. She is the spear behind every empire, the blade behind every throne.</p>

Wisdom’s Blade

 No crown, no kiss, no silken flame—
 But I will carve for you a name
 In every war, on every field
 Where wit endures, the sword must yield

 I give you more than mortal breath—
 The mind that outmaneuvers death

 Wisdom’s blade, sharper than steel
 Strike unseen, make tyrants kneel
 No fate can bind the one who knows—
 Let thought be fire, and war your throne

 While others rule, and others lust—
 I offer law that will not rust
 The power to read the hearts of kings
 And bind them with unspoken strings

 Take up my helm, my shield, my lore—
 And fear no blade forevermore

 Wisdom’s blade, sharper than steel
 Strike unseen, make tyrants kneel
 No fate can bind the one who knows—
 Let thought be fire, and war your throne

 What is beauty but a mask?
 What is power but a task?
 I offer vision through the haze—
 To win without the world’s praise

 ATHENA: “Choose me... and you will never lose a battle again.”

 Wisdom’s blade, forged in flame
 Your mind the forge, the world your game
 Let others fall to fire or chain—
 You’ll wear the truth, and truth shall reign

 Let wisdom guide, let fury learn—
 The path I carve will not return
    </pre>
