    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The album begins with the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, the mortal king and the sea goddess. All gods are invited—except Eris, the goddess of discord. In revenge, she throws a golden apple into the feast, inscribed: “To the Fairest.”</p>
    <p>Three goddesses lay claim to it: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Thus begins a divine rivalry that will lead to the Judgment of Paris, the abduction of Helen, and ultimately the Trojan War.</p>
    <p>This is not just a banquet—it is the moment divine pride sows mortal doom. The spark before the flame.</p>

The Banquet of Gods

 Golden halls, a feast divine
 Ambrosia flows, the stars align
 The gods in song, the mortals kneel—
 A bond of fate, a sacred seal

 Peleus weds the sea-born flame
 And all Olympus speaks her name

 Raise the cups and light the skies
 Let no omen dark arise
 But in the joy, a shadow stirs—
 A voice unbid, a doom that purrs

 Eris stood beyond the gate
 Cloaked in silence, crowned by hate
 No seat for her, no wine, no throne—
 So she carved her gift in polished bone

 “To the fairest,” etched in spite—
 A spark to turn the day to night

 Raise the cups and light the skies
 Let no omen dark arise
 But one small fruit, one golden flare—
 Will tear the heavens, bleed the air

 Hera stood with eyes like flame
 Athena’s wrath was cold and plain
 And Aphrodite’s smile betrayed
 The war that silence had obeyed

 [ZEUS (deep, fading)] “I will not choose…”
 [HERA (commanding)] “It is mine…”
 [ATHENA (cutting)] “Let wisdom weigh…”
 [APHRODITE (serpentine)] “Let love decide…”
 [ERIS (echo)] “Let all burn.”

 Raise the cups and light the skies
 Let no omen dark arise
 But from one apple, carved in spite—
 Will blaze a war that drowns the light

 Let the feast end. Let fate begin.
 The apple rolls. The gods give in.
