    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The pivotal moment of the Judgment of Paris. After hearing the offers of Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite, Paris chooses love over power or wisdom. He gives the golden apple to Aphrodite, who has promised him Helen of Sparta.</p>
    <p>This choice does not only insult the other goddesses—it fractures Olympus and sets fire to the future. Hera and Athena, spurned and enraged, turn against Troy. What began as desire becomes destiny.</p>

Paris Chooses

Three stood before me, veiled in might
One crowned in gold, one clothed in light
One smiled like dusk, with fire beneath—
And each could shape the world’s belief

What gift is worth eternal blame?
Which voice will burn, which will remain?

Paris chooses, fate ignites
The flame I touch will swallow rights
One apple rolls, the gods divide—
And all of Troy must match my pride

Hera promised sovereign rule
Athena’s gaze was sharp and cruel
But in her eyes, the sea grew still—
And beauty bent my mortal will

No war could break what love could move—
Or so I thought... or dared to prove

Paris chooses, fate ignites
The flame I touch will swallow rights
One apple rolls, the gods divide—
And all of Troy must match my pride

I gave the gold to lips that swore
That Helen’s heart would soon be more
I saw the sky begin to tear—
And yet I smiled beneath her stare

PARIS: “A kiss for a kingdom... A choice for a grave...”

Paris chooses, gods recoil
One step, one gift, and kingdoms spoil
I took her face, I damned my kin—
And now the war begins within

I held the apple, gold and clean—
But touched the thread that cuts the queen
    </pre>
