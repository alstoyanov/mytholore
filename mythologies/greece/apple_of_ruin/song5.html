    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>As Paris prepares to choose the fairest goddess, Aphrodite makes her offer—not a kingdom or victory, but Helen of Sparta, the most beautiful woman in the world. With a single promise, she ensures her victory.</p>
    <p>Helen’s beauty would ignite the Trojan War, doom thousands, and destroy empires. But in this moment, she is not yet a queen or a curse—only a vision offered to a young prince under divine temptation.</p>
    <p>Aphrodite is more than charm. She is the eternal hunger in all things. This song is the moment desire becomes destiny.</p>

    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
The Flame of Desire

You seek to rule? You seek to win?
I offer what consumes within
Not thrones, not war, but sweeter fire—
The spark that gods and mortals tire

A touch that breaks a hundred kings
A name that fate forever sings

The flame of desire, soft as breath
But burns a path that leads to death
One glance, one kiss, the world undone—
And she will be your only sun

Her voice will silence every prayer
Her face will haunt the lion’s lair
For Helen walks with storm and grace—
And you shall die to see her face

No army dares what love has sewn—
And none forget what I have shown

The flame of desire, soft as breath
But burns a path that leads to death
One glance, one kiss, the world undone—
And she will be your only sun

Let wisdom falter, power fade—
For all men kneel to what I made
Choose me, and she will be your bride—
The gods won’t stop what burns inside

APHRODITE: “She is yours. And in her arms… the fall begins.”

The flame of desire, soft as breath
But burns a path that leads to death
One glance, one kiss, the world undone—
And soon you’ll see what love has won

And in her eyes, a thousand graves—
A gift too bright for gods to save
    </pre>
