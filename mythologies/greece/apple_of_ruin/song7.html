    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The final track of The Apple of Ruin steps outside the realm of gods and mortals. It is Fate who now speaks—the force that watches, records, and waits. Fate did not interfere when Eris cast her apple, when Paris made his choice, or when Helen boarded a ship. It simply witnessed.</p>
    <p>The Trojan War has not begun yet—but it will. This track closes the album like a tomb door sealing shut: the knowledge that all the players have chosen their parts, and the stage is now built for fire, death, and legend.</p>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
To Burn a World

I do not speak to change the path
I do not rise with joy or wrath
I watch the hands that shaped the flame—
And carve the echo from the name

You thought it love, you thought it pride—
But it was I who watched you slide

To burn a world, you need one spark
A golden lie, a whispered heart
You crowned desire in war's disguise—
And fed your gods with mortal cries

She sailed the sea, you lit the shore
Now every oath becomes a war
No gift, no vow, no kiss is clean—
You chose the thread, I split the seam

And in your hands, the furies sleep—
Until you wake what won’t keep peace

To burn a world, you need one spark
A golden lie, a whispered heart
You crowned desire in war's disguise—
And fed your gods with mortal cries

Hera weeps, Athena plots
Aphrodite takes her cost
Paris bleeds, and Helen breaks—
And I remain for all mistakes

FATE: “You named her beauty. You made her flame.
Now carry your ruin without shame.”

To burn a world, you need one spark
A single choice, a lover's mark
I watched it fall, I let it be—
For fate is forged in what you see

You dreamed of gods.
You woke to fire.
The war has only just begun.
