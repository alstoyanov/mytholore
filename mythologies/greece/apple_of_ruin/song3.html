    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>In the Judgment of Paris, Hera—wife of Zeus and queen of Olympus—offers Paris ultimate dominion: rulership over all of Asia and the known world. Her appeal is power, stability, and legacy. She offers no affection or illusion—only the truth of empire.</p>
    <p>Where Aphrodite offers love and Athena offers victory, Hera offers command. Hers is the voice of divine law, sovereignty, and royal ambition. She does not ask—she declares.</p>
    <p>This song gives Hera her due: not as a petty rival, but as a cosmic monarch offering the weight of destiny in her outstretched hand.</p>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
Crown of Empires

 I am the throne that fate obeys
 The law that bends the mortal blaze
 I do not beg, I do not plead—
 I offer worlds for but one deed

 Give me the apple, weigh the crown—
 And watch the earth bow softly down

 Crown of empires, gift of queens
 The rule of men by fated means
 You want the world? I hold its key—
 The sky will bend if you choose me

 Do you not dream of kings undone?
 Of banners blackened by your sun?
 I offer steel that shapes the sea—
 Your name will thunder endlessly

 I do not deal in fleeting charms—
 But thrones that sleep in waiting arms

 Crown of empires, gift of queens
 The rule of men by fated means
 You want the world? I hold its key—
 The sky will bend if you choose me

 Helen fades and wars will pass—
 But power forged in gold will last
 Beauty dies and love betrays—
 But empires live in endless days

 “Choose me, and kings will kneel. 
Spurn me... and even gods will grieve.”

 Crown of empires, gift of queens
 Let kingdoms burn to birth your dreams
 I am Olympus, I am the flame—
 And all the world can bear your name

 So place your fate in regal hands—
 And walk with gods through mortal lands
    </pre>
