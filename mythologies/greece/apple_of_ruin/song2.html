    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>After the golden apple was cast into the divine banquet, and Zeus refused to choose between the goddesses, the task of judgment was passed to a mortal: Paris, a Trojan prince raised in exile.</p>
    <p>He is brought to Mount Ida, where he is told he must decide which goddess—Hera, Athena, or Aphrodite—deserves the title of “the fairest.” Each will offer him a gift. His choice will decide not only his fate, but the fate of nations.</p>
    <p>This song captures the moment before that choice—the weight of destiny pressing down on one man, caught between awe, terror, and temptation.</p>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
Judgment at Dawn

They found me where the shepherds stray
A crownless prince turned man of clay
They spoke of gods, of golden pride—
And brought me to this mountainside

They say I choose, they say I judge—
But who am I to weigh such blood?

Judgment at dawn, I wait in dread
Three fates approach with fire-fed tread
Their names are war, and rule, and flame—
And all will burn beneath one name

The sky is still, the air stands dry
Even the sun forgets to rise
I feel their footsteps in the ground
A hush that screams without a sound

A throne of bone, a world on hold—
The apple gleams with wrath untold

Judgment at dawn, I wait in dread
Three fates approach with fire-fed tread
Their names are war, and rule, and flame—
And all will burn beneath one name

What gift is this, to damn or crown?
To be the spark that gods hand down?
I fear their gaze, I fear their grace—
But more I fear a ruined face

PARIS: “Let none envy me this choice... for no hand can lift it clean.”

Judgment at dawn, the sky turns red
Three goddesses, the oath I dread
The world will turn, the war will rise—
Because I looked in three divine eyes

And in their beauty, death drew near—
The war began with whispered fear     
    </pre>
