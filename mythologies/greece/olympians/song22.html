    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Veil of Death" is an ethereal, cinematic song honoring the rarely depicted female embodiment of Thanatos, the Greek spirit of peaceful death. Often overshadowed by Hades or the more violent aspects of mortality, Thanatos represents the serene, inevitable passage from life to afterlife. She is the twilight, the silent grace, the one who takes no joy, but offers release.</p>
<p>Thanatos is the Greek god and personification of death, often depicted as a winged, shadowy figure who gently leads souls to the underworld. Unlike violent death in battle (which was handled by the Keres or gods like Ares), Thanatos represented peaceful, inevitable death — a natural end rather than a bloody one. He is the twin brother of Hypnos (Sleep) and a child of Nyx (Night) and Erebus (Darkness). Though feared by mortals, Thanatos was not cruel; he was an unyielding but calm force, untouched by bribery or trickery — though heroes like Heracles once wrestled him to save lives. In Greek art and myth, Thanatos symbolizes the quiet, inescapable embrace that awaits all beings.</p>

Thanatos: Veil of Death

I walk unseen where shadows cling
No crown I wear, no sword I swing
I am the hush at journey’s close
The breath you take before repose

I do not weep, I do not grieve
I only come when you must leave

I am the veil, the falling light
I’ll guide your soul into the night
No fear, no flame, no pain, no loss
Just rest beneath the wings of Thanatos

You call me death, but I am peace
The quiet song when all must cease
No judgment here, no cruel decree
I open doors — you walk through me

You’ve heard my name in whispered breath
But I am not the end — just death

I am the veil, the falling light
I’ll guide your soul into the night
No fear, no flame, no pain, no loss
Just rest beneath the wings of Thanatos

The brave, the lost, the young, the old
Each tale returns to me, retold
I hold them all within my grace
Each soul, a star I must embrace

I do not choose, I do not chase
I only meet you face to face
When all is still and time lets go
I’ll be the one you’ll come to know

I am the veil, the falling light
I’ll guide your soul into the night
No fear, no flame, no pain, no loss
Just rest beneath the wings of Thanatos

So close your eyes, and breathe me in
I am not where it ends — I’m where you begin

    </pre>
