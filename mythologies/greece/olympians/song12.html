    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Winged Tongue" channels the quicksilver essence of Hermes, the Greek god of messengers, travelers, and thieves. This song follows his cunning rise—from stealing Apollo’s cattle as an infant to guiding the souls of the dead and delivering the will of the gods. Both revered and feared for his wit and speed, Hermes is the voice between worlds, the patron of crossroads and clever escape.</p>
<p>Hermes is the son of Zeus and Maia, known for his winged sandals, caduceus staff, and mischievous grin. He is the messenger of the gods, god of commerce, travelers, and trickery, and the psychopomp who leads souls to the Underworld. He plays roles both serious and sly, trusted with divine authority and feared for his unpredictability.</p>

Hermes: Winged Tongue

I was born with lies on my breath
Stole Apollo's herd before my first step
Winged sandals, sharper than fate
I dance through doors no lock can wait

I speak in riddles, trade in truth
Your secrets fly when I slip through

Winged tongue, silver glide
I run through gods, through death, through pride
Messenger, thief, trickster divine—
Every road and tale is mine

From market stalls to shadowed tombs
I ferry souls and shape what blooms
I guide the lost, I charm the damned
I write the rules with sleight of hand

The gods all whisper when I smile
For I can shift the fate of trial

Winged tongue, silver glide
I run through gods, through death, through pride
Messenger, thief, trickster divine—
Every road and tale is mine

They call on me when time runs thin
To carry words through war and sin
Olympus speaks, but I deliver
What slips my hands will drown the river

“I Carry the law to mortal breath.”
“And what if I rewrite the rest?”

Winged tongue, silver glide
I run through gods, through death, through pride
Messenger, thief, trickster divine—
Every road and tale is mine

So pray your words reach heaven's gate—
I run with wind. I run with fate.
