    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Hands of Resurrection" tells the story of Asclepius, the divine healer who dared to challenge death itself. Gifted with the power to bring the dead back to life, he became both miracle and threat to the gods. His compassion was his rebellion. The song is a powerful tribute to healing as divinity, and the price of mercy in a world ruled by immortal pride.</p>
<p>Asclepius is the son of Apollo and the mortal Coronis. Trained in the healing arts by the centaur Chiron, he became the greatest physician in myth, even learning to resurrect the dead. His powers defied the natural order, leading Zeus to strike him down with a thunderbolt. Asclepius’s rod, entwined with a serpent, remains a symbol of medicine today.</p>

Asclepius: Hands of Resurrection

They called it fate when bodies fell
But I saw wounds and knew them well
With serpent staff and healer’s touch
I gave the dying back too much

The gods may rule, but I repair—
The threads they snap, I stitch with care

Hands of resurrection, calm and bold
I raise the warm from bodies cold
Where death once claimed, I dared defy
And made the gods look down and cry

My father lit the sky with flame
Yet still they feared my growing name
Apollo’s blood, but not his rage—
I walked the sick from cage to stage

I brought back sons, I woke the lost
But healing came at divine cost

Hands of resurrection, calm and bold
I raise the warm from bodies cold
Where death once claimed, I dared defy
And made the gods look down and cry

They struck me down for what I knew
But even now, my art breaks through
The rod I held still winds in flame—
In every cure, they chant my name

No god may grant what youI revoke.
Then fear the fire in mortal hope.

Hands of resurrection, calm and bold
I raise the warm from bodies cold
Where death once claimed, I dared defy
And made the gods look down and cry

So if you rise where death once lay—
Know that I once led the way
    </pre>
