    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Zeus is the chief deity in Greek mythology, ruling over the heavens, the earth, and the mortal realm. As the son of Cronus and Rhea, he rose to power after leading the Olympians in the Titanomachy, a fierce battle that ended with the overthrow of his father, Cronus, and the rise of a new cosmic order. Zeus is known for wielding the thunderbolt, a symbol of his authority, and for his role as a protector and enforcer of justice among gods and mortals. He is often depicted as the embodiment of divine law, yet also as a figure marked by complex relationships and numerous affairs.</p>
<p>In this song, "Thunderborne," Zeus' power and authority are explored as he rules the skies and enforces law upon both gods and men. His relationship with his wife Hera is also touched upon, reflecting the turbulent nature of divine power and the weight of the throne he holds.</p>

Zeus – "Thunderborne"

 I rise with storms wrapped in my name
 Skyfather crowned in thunder's flame
 Mount Olympus bows beneath my feet
 Every oath, every fear, repeats

 The clouds obey, the lightning calls
 My justice cracks through heaven's walls

 I am the thunder, I am the king
 The storm that breaks, the law I bring
 From golden throne to mortal breath
 I rule with love, I strike with death

 My brothers warred, but I stood tall
 Sky, sea, and underworld — we split it all
 Their tides may rage, their fire may burn
 But lightning never waits its turn

 The eagle screams, the heavens bend
 My will begins where mortals end

 I am the thunder, I am the king
 The storm that breaks, the law I bring
 From golden throne to mortal breath
 I rule with love, I strike with death

 A hundred lovers, a thousand lies
 Still, Olympus burns under my skies
 Let gods plot in shadows deep
 But none shall wake what I let sleep

 (Hera, bitter, cold and proud)
 HERA: "You call this love? You shame our vow."
 ZEUS: "You swore to storm, not to peace..."
 (Hera fades into thunder growls)

 I am the thunder, I am the king
 The storm that breaks, the law I bring
 From golden throne to mortal breath
 I rule with love, I strike with death

 Bow your heads, let fear be born
 For gods don’t weep—they ride the storm
    </pre>
