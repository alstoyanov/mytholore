    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Witchflame" gives voice to Hecate, the enigmatic goddess of magic, thresholds, and the unseen. She is the light in the dark, the guide between life and death, and the mistress of shadowed power. This final track honors her as the force who illuminates hidden truths, walks with the dead, and empowers those who dwell in mystery and moonlight.</p>
<p>Hecate is the Greek goddess of magic, witchcraft, necromancy, and the crossroads. She is often depicted carrying torches, accompanied by black dogs, and shown with three faces to symbolize her dominion over past, present, and future. Revered by witches and feared by mortals, Hecate is a liminal figure—powerful, wise, and unbound by the laws of Olympus.</p>

Hecate: Witchflame

I walk the paths where mortals fear
The veil is thin when I am near
With torches lit and shadows three
I guard the gate where fates unweave

No prayer can guide where I have tread
I speak with ghosts, I dine with dread

Witchflame burning in the dark
I mark the road, I leave the spark
Where moonlight bends and secrets crawl
I rise at every twilight call

The hounds howl low, the roots run deep
Where witches wake and dead don’t sleep
I light the crossroad, spell the storm
And bless the curse in shifting form

No chain can bind, no law restrain
The path I walk forgets your name

Witchflame burning in the dark
I mark the road, I leave the spark
Where moonlight bends and secrets crawl
I rise at every twilight call

When gods retreat, I still remain
To whisper fate and open vein
I know what lives beneath the skin—
The buried truth, the wrath within

I never left you.
I never do.

Witchflame burning in the dark
I mark the road, I leave the spark
Where moonlight bends and secrets crawl
I rise at every twilight call

So strike the match, and speak my name—
The dark ignites in witchflame
    </pre>
