    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>“Wheel in My Hands” is a dynamic, myth-inspired song sung from the perspective of Tyche, the Greek goddess of fortune, fate, and chance. Often depicted holding a wheel or cornucopia, Tyche represents the unpredictable nature of life’s highs and lows.</p>
<p>Tyche is the Greek goddess of fortune, luck, and the unpredictable twists of fate. Often depicted holding a cornucopia overflowing with riches and a wheel symbolizing the constant change of destiny, she governs both prosperity and disaster without bias. Tyche embodies the randomness of life’s outcomes, steering the lives of individuals and the fates of entire cities according to her whims. Revered especially during times of uncertainty, she was seen as both a protector and a capricious force beyond human control, reminding mortals that success and ruin often come without warning.</p>
<p>Whether you’ve praised her in triumph or cursed her in defeat, Tyche remains the hidden hand behind the game of life. She doesn’t play favorites — her gifts are sudden, her withdrawals swift.</p>

Tyche: Wheel in My Hands

They build their temples, cast their dice
Pray for gold or paradise
But I don’t answer every prayer
I move unseen, I'm always there

I never warn, I never stay
I turn the tide, then slip away

The wheel is in my hands tonight
I spin your fate in shadowed light
Fortune favors none for long
To me, the lucky and the wrong
I am chance, I am design
The rise, the fall — both hands are mine

You call me luck, or bless my name
But curse me when I shift the game
I'm not your wish, I’m not your fear
I’m everything that brought you here

You chase the stars, you seek control
But I decide what stories roll

The wheel is in my hands tonight
I spin your fate in shadowed light
Fortune favors none for long
To me, the lucky and the wrong
I am chance, I am design
The rise, the fall — both hands are mine

A kingdom lost, a beggar crowned
A single step can shift the ground
I hold the thread, I cut, I bind
The future bends beneath my mind

No map, no sign will lead you through
I change the path — not even you
Can tame the tide, or break my flow
I am the dice you’ll never throw

The wheel is in my hands tonight
I spin your fate in shadowed light
Fortune favors none for long
To me, the lucky and the wrong
I am chance, I am design
The rise, the fall — both hands are mine

So make your move, and take your stand
But know your fate is in my hand
    </pre>
