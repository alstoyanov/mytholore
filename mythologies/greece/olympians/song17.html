    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Arrow of Want" reveals Eros not as a cherub of romance, but as the primal force behind longing, obsession, and destruction. This track explores the god’s dual nature—his power to unite and to ruin, to spark love or hatred with a single shot. From the fall of Troy to the torment of Psyche, Eros’s influence is seductive, inescapable, and devastating.</p>
<p>Eros is the Greek god of love, attraction, and desire. Often depicted with wings and a bow, he can shoot arrows that cause love or revulsion. In later mythology, he becomes a son of Aphrodite and plays a central role in myths like that of Eros and Psyche. He is not just a playful force—he is the embodiment of the most irrational and powerful emotions.</p>

Eros: Arrow of Want

A glance, a pulse, a sharpened breath
I aim, you crave, you bleed to death
My wings are soft, my hands are small
But kings have wept beneath my call

You name it love, you say it's fate
But I just twist, then watch you break

Arrow of want, silver flight
Pierce the heart and blind the sight
What starts with heat ends in flame
And still you whisper out my name

They think I play with hearts and lace
But I have scarred the strongest face
I sparked the war of Troy’s own fall
With just one kiss, I doomed them all

No prayer can shield, no law can bind
Desire is cruel, and I design

Arrow of want, silver flight
Pierce the heart and blind the sight
What starts with heat ends in flame
And still you whisper out my name

My mother calls me soft and kind
But even gods have lost their minds
When my two arrows take their flight—
One brings love, the other spite

“You ask why must love hurt?”
“I tell you cecause it’s real.”

Arrow of want, silver flight
Pierce the heart and blind the sight
What starts with heat ends in flame
And still you whisper out my name

So kiss the pain, and curse the air—
You asked for love. I left you bare.
