    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Poseidon, brother of Zeus and Hades, is the god of the sea, earthquakes, and storms. Wielding a mighty trident, he rules over all waters and creatures within them. Fierce and proud, Poseidon is known for his volatile nature—capable of great creation, such as horses and islands, but also of immense destruction when angered. He is a protector of sailors and seafarers, yet many fear him for his mood swings and his role in sinking ships or flooding lands.</p>
<p>This song, "Drown the World," tells the story of Poseidon's power and pride. It draws on myths like the destruction of Atlantis and his infamous vendetta against Odysseus, revealing a god who commands the oceans but demands respect. It portrays him not only as a wrathful deity but also as a guardian of balance within the vast and ancient deep.</p>

Poseidon: Drown the World

Brother crowned the sky, I took the tide
Salt and fury are where I reside
Tridents tremble in my grasp
Oceans kneel with every gasp

Tsunamis answer when I call
The sea remembers every fall

I drown the world when I’m denied
The waves obey, the storms collide
Beneath your ships, my kingdom lies
You breathe by mercy, not by right

I carved the reefs with wrath and might
Crushed proud Atlantis out of spite
The kraken sleeps where secrets bleed
A god ignored is a god you’ll need

The tides rise up to crush your name
No man can cage a god untamed

I drown the world when I’m denied
The waves obey, the storms collide
Beneath your ships, my kingdom lies
You breathe by mercy, not by right

I hear the whispers of the deep
Sailors cry and lovers weep
But I am more than rage and roar
I guard the sea, I am its core

ODYSSEUS: "Have mercy, Lord, I only sought home..."
POSEIDON: "Then you should have feared my wrath before you blinded my blood."

I drown the world when I’m denied
The waves obey, the storms collide
Beneath your ships, my kingdom lies
You breathe by mercy, not by right

The sea is endless, cold, and bold—
And I am its fury, old and gold
    </pre>
