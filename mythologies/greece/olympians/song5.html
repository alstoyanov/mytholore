    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Seed of Sorrow" tells the tragic myth of Demeter and her daughter Persephone. When Persephone is abducted by Hades to be queen of the Underworld, Demeter’s anguish brings the world to a halt. Crops fail, seasons cease, and mortals suffer until a deal is made: Persephone would return for half the year, giving rise to the seasons. The song is sung from Demeter’s perspective, embodying the raw, maternal grief and divine vengeance that reshaped nature itself.</p>
<p>Demeter is one of the Olympian goddesses, governing agriculture, grain, and fertility. She is the mother of Persephone and is deeply tied to the seasonal cycle. Her story reflects the pain of loss and the resilience of nature, symbolized through the death and rebirth of crops each year.</p>

Demeter: Seed of Sorrow

They took my child beneath the crust
With hands like stone and hearts unjust
I called the earth, I stopped the rain
And let the wheat scream out in pain

You feast on fruits that grew from me
But taste now famine’s memory

Seed of sorrow, bloom of wrath
I carve my grief in nature’s path
The world will starve, the sun will pale
Until my daughter leaves the veil

I begged Olympus, cold and high
But even gods let mothers cry
The fields lay bare, the rivers dry
My joy is caged beneath the sky

Her name still echoes in the trees
Each root a root of tragedies

Seed of sorrow, bloom of wrath
I carve my grief in nature’s path
The world will starve, the sun will pale
Until my daughter leaves the veil

The deal was struck, the wheel must turn
Half the year I watch and burn
But when she rises from the gloom
The earth reclaims its breath, its bloom

Mother, I return in spring...
Then let the harvest rise and sing.

Seed of sorrow, bloom of wrath
I carve my grief in nature’s path
The world will starve, the sun will pale
Until my daughter leaves the veil

So reap what pain the gods have sown—
A mother’s grief becomes your own
