    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"War in Wisdom" gives voice to Athena, the goddess who governs not chaos, but strategy, intellect, and purpose. In this track, Athena challenges the brute force of Ares, affirming her belief that true power lies in planning, insight, and controlled execution. Her presence in war is calm, precise, and inevitable—shaping heroes and nations through guidance, not rage.</p>
<p>Athena is one of the most revered Olympians, the goddess of wisdom, warfare strategy, and crafts. Born fully armed from the head of Zeus, she is both a warrior and a thinker. Athena played crucial roles in myths like the Odyssey, and her sacred symbols—the owl and the olive tree—represent intellect and peace through strength.</p>

Athena: War and Wisdom

Born from thought, not blood and womb
I rose in armor, sword and plume
Where war meets mind, I draw the line
Not for conquest—discipline is mine

The battlefield is not just flame
It's where the wise earn more than fame

War in wisdom, sharp and clean
A blade of thought, not brute obscene
Where others burn, I calculate
And through precision, dominate

They praise brute force, they sing of scars
But I forge generals, not just war
With every trap and every feint
I paint the world in silent paint

The owl sees where chaos hides
I strike not wide—I strike with pride

War in wisdom, sharp and clean
A blade of thought, not brute obscene
Where others burn, I calculate
And through precision, dominate

I guided kings with silver schemes
Built cities out of broken dreams
I taught the brave to rise, not fall—
To lead with logic, not just brawl

“You count while I conquer.”
ATHENA: “And yet it’s I who wins the war.”

War in wisdom, sharp and clean
A blade of thought, not brute obscene
Where others burn, I calculate

Let brawlers charge and scream and miss—
I end all battles with a kiss
    </pre>
