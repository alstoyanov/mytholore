    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Eternal Flame" is a hymn of steadiness and sacred warmth, told from the perspective of Hestia—the quietest of the Olympians. Though she abandoned her throne to avoid conflict, her presence remains at the heart of every temple, every home, and every sacred fire. The song is a tribute to her quiet power, her role as guardian of peace, and her unseen influence over stability and ritual.</p>
<p>Hestia is the Greek goddess of the hearth, home, and domestic life. Eldest of the Olympians and first to be swallowed by Cronus, she is also the last to be released. She willingly gave up her seat among the Twelve Olympians for peace, and in return, her flame is honored in every sacred fire. She represents selflessness, warmth, and the center of civilization.</p>

Hestia: Eternal Flame

They raise their swords, they chase the sky
But I remain when gods go by
In every hearth, in every stone
You’ll find me burning, soft and lone

I do not roar, I do not fight
But I am warmth in endless night

Eternal flame, quiet light
I hold the walls through every fight
Where kings have knelt and homes have burned
My silent flame has still returned

They passed me by with war and pride
But I refused to leave your side
I feed the soul, the bread, the prayer
The sacred peace in mortal care

No temple grand, no throne of gold
Yet I am all your hands can hold

Eternal flame, quiet light
I hold the walls through every fight
Where kings have knelt and homes have burned
My silent flame has still returned

I gave my seat, I gave my name
To keep Olympus free from shame
Yet in each home, my fire lives—
And through each loss, it softly gives

“I never fought, yet we endure.”
“Because I burn. Because I cure.”

Eternal flame, quiet light
I hold the walls through every fight
Where kings have knelt and homes have burned
My silent flame has still returned

So light your fire and say my grace—
The humble flame time can’t erase
    </pre>
