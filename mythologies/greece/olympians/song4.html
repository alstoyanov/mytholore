    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Crown of Vengeance" gives voice to Hera, the proud and powerful queen of Olympus, goddess of marriage, and divine protector of women. This track explores her rage toward Zeus's betrayals and her tireless pursuit of justice and respect in a world of infidelity and arrogance. In myth, Hera is known for her cunning and wrath, particularly toward Zeus’s lovers and illegitimate children. But beneath her fury is a sovereign force who demands reverence.</p>
<p>The song embodies her strength, her pain, and her refusal to be overshadowed. Hera is not a passive queen—she is the divine lawmaker of Olympus, and her vengeance is sacred.</p>
<p>Who is Hera? Hera is the goddess of marriage, women, and family, and the wife and sister of Zeus. Despite being often portrayed as jealous or vindictive, she is also a symbol of dignity, endurance, and authority. Her myths include punishments of Io, Leto, and Heracles—testaments to the pain of betrayal and the ferocity of divine honor.</p>

Hera: Crown of Vengeance

My throne is gold, but not for show
Each lie you told, each seed you sow
I watched, I waited, fire sealed
The queen of storms no man can wield

You took your pleasure, left me scorned
Now feel the weight of vows you’ve torn

I wear the crown of vengeance bright
A wife betrayed, a queen in fight
My fury sings in sacred flame
You’ll curse the day you spoke my name

Goddess of hearth, but not your maid
My wrath is law when trust decays
Olympus shakes when I arise
Justice burns behind these eyes

You think me weak—behind your storm
But even gods must face reform

I wear the crown of vengeance bright
A wife betrayed, a queen in fight
My fury sings in sacred flame
You’ll curse the day you spoke my name

Let mortals fear the mother’s cry
Their sons and kings beneath my sky
From love to rage, I rule alone
The blood of gods supports my throne

ZEUS (distant): “Hera, you burn with ancient fire…”
HERA: “You lit it first—now choke on ire.”

I wear the crown of vengeance bright
A wife betrayed, a queen in fight
My fury sings in sacred flame
You’ll curse the day you spoke my name

Crown me cruel, crown me bold—
But never again left in the cold

    </pre>
