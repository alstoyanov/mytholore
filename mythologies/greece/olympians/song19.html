    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Wings of Victory" is a triumphant anthem told through the voice of Nike, divine embodiment of success and glory. In battlefields and arenas, she appears unseen, crowning the worthy. This song explores her eternal presence in every triumph, from heroic last stands to quiet personal wins. Victory, she reminds us, is not forged by strength alone—but by the moment she chooses to bless.</p>
<p>Nike is the Greek goddess of victory, closely associated with both war and peaceful competition. Often depicted with wings, she flies swiftly across the battlefield to reward the worthy. She frequently appears beside Athena in myth and was honored by both soldiers and athletes. Nike is the spirit behind every lasting achievement and every name written in glory.</p>

Nike: Wings of Victory

I soar above the clash and flame
The breath of triumph in my name
When mortals fight and heroes fall
It’s I who rise to crown them all

No sword I wield, no shield I bear
But in my wings, all glory flares

Wings of victory, winds of fate
I fly where legends resonate
In every cry, in every cheer
Know that my whisper brought you here

They call for war, they crave renown
But only I place laurel crown
From bloodied fields to games of grace
The breath of triumph wears my face

No banner waves without my will
I am the silence that stands still

Wings of victory, winds of fate
I fly where legends resonate
In every cry, in every cheer
Know that my whisper brought you here

I saw Achilles meet his end
Yet still his name the stars defend
For I was there, I held his soul
And marked his fire on every scroll

ATHENA (echo): “You crown the brave who play my game…”
NIKE: “But none are known without my name.”

Wings of victory, winds of fate
I fly where legends resonate
In every cry, in every cheer
Know that my whisper brought you here

So when you stand above the rest—
It’s I who kissed your battle crest
