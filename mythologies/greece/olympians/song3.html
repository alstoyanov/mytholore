    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Throne Beneath the World" gives voice to Hades, the solemn and powerful ruler of the Greek Underworld. Far from the villain he is often mistaken for, Hades is a god of balance, judgment, and necessary endings. The song explores his reign over the dead, the inevitable pull of mortality, and his relationship with Persephone, who rules beside him as queen. In Greek myth, Hades rarely leaves his realm, yet his influence touches every mortal life.</p>
<p>This song focuses on his role as a just and incorruptible force in the cosmos, not evil, but final. It also portrays Persephone not as a victim, but as a willing co-ruler, lending nuance to one of mythology's most misunderstood stories.</p>
<p>Who is Hades?</p>
<p>Hades is the god of the Underworld, brother to Zeus and Poseidon. After defeating the Titans, the three brothers divided the world—Zeus took the sky, Poseidon the sea, and Hades the realm of the dead. He governs the souls of the deceased and ensures the order of life and death. Though grim, Hades is not malevolent. He is also associated with the hidden wealth of the earth and the concept of balance</p>

Hades: Throne Beneath the World

I sit where light forgets to tread
A crown of ash upon my head
No fire, no feast, no foolish pride
Just judgment in the dark I bide

The river sings, the ferryman rows
Each soul the silence surely knows

I am the king beneath your feet
Where all your ends and echoes meet
You fear my name, but death is fair
And in my halls, you're stripped bare

Let Zeus have storms, let Poseidon roar
I rule what comes after war
No heroes cheat what I contain
Even gods descend in chains

No glory shines where shades are kept
Just memories that gods have wept

I am the king beneath your feet
Where all your ends and echoes meet
You fear my name, but death is fair
And in my halls, you're stripped bare

Persephone, my winter bride
Brings spring to lands when by my side
I do not steal—I offer peace
A throne of stillness, cold release

PERSEPHONE (soft but firm): "He gave me truth when others lied..."
HADES: "Not all darkness should be denied."

I am the king beneath your feet
Where all your ends and echoes meet
You fear my name, but death is fair
And in my halls, you're stripped bare

So light your candles, burn them bright—
But every flame must face the night
