    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Beautiful Curse" is the voice of Aphrodite in her most divine and dangerous form. This track explores how beauty, love, and desire can lead to devastation. From the Trojan War sparked by her gift to Paris, to her affairs with gods and mortals, Aphrodite weaves a path of passion and ruin. She is not a comfort—she is a force. The song captures the seductive power of a goddess who gives pleasure wrapped in peril.</p>
<p>Aphrodite is the Greek goddess of love, beauty, passion, and sensuality. Born from the sea foam after the fall of Uranus, she is often accompanied by doves and roses. She had many lovers, including Ares and Adonis, and was married to Hephaestus. While she inspires love, she also ignites jealousy, war, and heartbreak—her influence is as dangerous as it is irresistible.</p>

Aphrodite: Beautiful Curse

I rise from foam, the ocean's sigh
A crown of longing in my eye
They build their empires just to kneel
Before the fire they long to feel

Desire’s touch is sweet and slow
But even roses bleed below

Beautiful curse, divine deceit
I make your weakness feel like heat
You beg, you burn, you tear apart
I never claimed to spare your heart

Paris asked, and I bestowed
But beauty buys a war that grows
A single smile, a thousand graves
And still, they call me love—not rage

I give the kiss, I write the war
What you adore—I break it more

Beautiful curse, divine deceit
I make your weakness feel like heat
You beg, you burn, you tear apart
I never claimed to spare your heart

My lovers fall, my name remains
Adorned in tears and golden chains
And still you chase what you can’t keep—
The god who watches while you sleep

“youI not enough for me?”
“You forged the shell. I fed the flame.”

Beautiful curse, divine deceit
I make your weakness feel like heat
You beg, you burn, you tear apart
I never claimed to spare your heart

So swear your love and write it deep—
Even gods know wounds that weep
