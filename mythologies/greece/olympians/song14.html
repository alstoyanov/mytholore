    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Madness in the Vine" channels the intoxicating duality of Dionysus—the liberator and destroyer. The track captures the wild, chaotic energy of his cult, the frenzy of the maenads, and the violent fate of those like Pentheus who tried to resist him. Dionysus speaks with seductive conviction, inviting mortals to lose control, transcend structure, and embrace divine madness.</p>
<p>Dionysus is the god of wine, fertility, theater, and religious ecstasy. A son of Zeus and the mortal Semele, he was born of both destruction and rebirth. He is worshiped through rites that break societal norms, embracing intoxication and liberation. Both revered and feared, Dionysus unchains the repressed and reveals the divine chaos within.</p>

Dionysus: Madness in the Vine

They called me strange, a god too wild
A mother’s shame, Olympus’ child
I walk in wine, I dance in flame
And every whisper knows my name

I tear the masks from mortal minds
To free the soul they try to bind

Madness in the vine, blood in the feast
I bring the peace that feels like beast
Tear off your name, your fear, your skin—
The god you run from lives within

Maenads scream beneath the moon
Their joy is sharp, their trance a tomb
I gift them madness, sweet and bright
The sacred loss of mortal sight

I give release, I break control
And pour myself in shattered bowls

Madness in the vine, blood in the feast
I bring the peace that feels like beast
Tear off your name, your fear, your skin—
The god you run from lives within

Pentheus fell to his own doubt
He dressed in robes, then blood poured out
He sought to cage what can’t be bound
But I wear chaos like a crown

“What madness is this?”
“Divinity you dared to dismiss.”

Madness in the vine, blood in the feast
I bring the peace that feels like beast
Tear off your name, your fear, your skin—
The god you run from lives within

So raise the cup and break your mind—
The end you fear is god-designed
