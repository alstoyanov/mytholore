    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Moon and Arrow" is a fierce, untamed anthem sung from the perspective of Artemis, protector of the wild and punisher of those who violate her sacred law. Through tales like Actaeon’s transformation and Niobe’s downfall, Artemis reveals her sharp justice and divine independence. The song embraces her role as a guardian of purity, a hunter, and a goddess who answers only to herself and the moon.</p>
<p>Artemis is the twin sister of Apollo and goddess of the hunt, wilderness, childbirth, and the moon. She is a virgin goddess known for her fierce independence and affinity with wild animals. Often depicted with a silver bow, Artemis punishes arrogance and protects the vulnerable. She is worshiped in wild places and revered by women and hunters alike.</p>

Artemis: Moon and Arrow

I run where men would never tread
Through silent woods, where stars have bled
My bow is drawn, my breath is still
I hunt the beast, I guard the will

The moon is mine, the night my flame
No man shall ever stake his claim

Moon and arrow, shadow bright
I strike in silence, I flee the light
Untamed, untouched, I walk alone
The wild is carved into my bone

They chase with fire, with lustful gaze
But I am older than their praise
Ask Actaeon what he saw—
My mercy hunts with tooth and claw

I don't forgive, I don't forget
My justice comes in silence, wet

Moon and arrow, shadow bright
I strike in silence, I flee the light
Untamed, untouched, I walk alone
The wild is carved into my bone

I shield the young, I guard the pure
My path is pain, but purpose sure
Let wolves and sisters walk beside—
The forest knows how gods can hide

“I killed them all...”
“Then speak no more of mortal thrall.”

Moon and arrow, shadow bright
I strike in silence, I flee the light
Untamed, untouched, I walk alone
The wild is carved into my bone

So raise no altar in my name—
The hunt is prayer, the woods, my flame
    </pre>
