    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Forge of Fire" gives a voice to Hephaestus—the outcast of Olympus, god of fire and the forge. Cast from the heavens for his imperfections, he rose in flame to shape the very tools the gods rely on. This track explores his isolation, his rage, and the pride he takes in creation. Hephaestus reminds us that those who are rejected often become the foundation on which greatness is built.</p>
<p>Hephaestus is the god of fire, metalwork, and craftsmanship. The son of Hera (and sometimes Zeus), he was thrown from Olympus for his deformity. He crafted the weapons of the gods, including Zeus’s thunderbolt and Achilles’s armor. Despite being mocked, he is indispensable. His story is one of suffering, resilience, and silent strength.</p>

Hephaestus: Forge of Fire

They hurled me down from heaven's gate
Crippled limbs and hands of fate
But in the ash, I shaped my name
With molten heart and hammer flame

They mocked the limp, they cursed the fall
But now they beg the tools I haul

Forge of fire, flame and pain
I rise from sparks they can’t contain
No throne, no crown, no gilded face—
But gods still kneel before my place

My anvils sing of wrath and steel
Of chains that gods themselves can feel
I built Olympus, gear by gear—
Yet still they laughed when I drew near

But every weapon, every throne
Was born beneath my hand alone

Forge of fire, flame and pain
I rise from sparks they can’t contain
No throne, no crown, no gilded face—
But gods still kneel before my place

She never loved the man she wed
But wore my jewels, my hearth, my bed
Let Ares boast of strength and pride—
My craft outlasts them when they’ve died

“yere were never mine.”
“Yet you wear what I forged from scars.”

Forge of fire, flame and pain
I rise from sparks they can’t contain
No throne, no crown, no gilded face—
But gods still kneel before my place

So strike me down and cast me low—
I’ll build the world from molten woe
    </pre>
