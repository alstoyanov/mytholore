    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Queen Below" tells the myth of Persephone from her own perspective, exploring the transformation from innocent maiden to sovereign of the dead. Taken by Hades into the Underworld, she becomes more than a victim—she becomes a ruler, a bridge between life and death. This song embodies her duality: daughter of spring and queen of shadows, symbol of both rebirth and eternal sleep.</p>
<p>Persephone is the daughter of Demeter, goddess of the harvest. She was abducted by Hades and became the queen of the Underworld. Due to her consumption of pomegranate seeds, she spends part of the year below and part above, symbolizing the seasonal cycle. Her story reflects themes of transformation, feminine power, and the coexistence of light and dark.</p>

Persephone: Queen Below

I danced in spring with flowers crowned
Until the earth beneath me frowned
A hand reached up from death’s domain
And stole me into shadow’s reign

My mother weeps, the rivers freeze
But down below, I learn to breathe

Queen below, I wear the dark
With petals crushed against my heart
Half the year I rise in light
Half I rule the endless night

He did not ask, yet still I stayed
In silence, I became unafraid
I tasted seeds, I broke the seal
And found a throne they said wasn’t real

Now I return with each year’s thaw
But part of me still loves the law

Queen below, I wear the dark
With petals crushed against my heart
Half the year I rise in light
Half I rule the endless night

They call me victim, call me prize
But none have looked behind my eyes
I made a crown of asphodel
And whispered peace where phantoms dwell

I come home, monther”
I never left—I walk both wilds.”

Queen below, I wear the dark
With petals crushed against my heart
Half the year I rise in light
Half I rule the endless night

So plant your seeds and watch them bloom—
I’ve walked the roots, I’ve kissed the gloom
    </pre>
