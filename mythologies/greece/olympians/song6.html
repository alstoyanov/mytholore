    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Blood for Glory" unleashes the raw, unfiltered voice of Ares—the Greek god who thrives not in strategy, but in the brutal chaos of battle. This song explores his disdain for diplomacy, his rivalry with Athena, and his sacred connection to bloodshed and valor. Speaking in his own words, Ares justifies his role in the pantheon: not as a monster, but as the necessary force that crowns heroes and decides empires.</p>
<p>Ares is the Greek god of war, representing the violent, untamed, and destructive aspects of conflict. Unlike Athena, who governs strategic warfare, Ares embodies bloodlust, fury, and the thrill of combat. Often scorned by the other Olympians, he is still revered in the chaos of war, where strength and survival rule.</p>

Ares: Blood for Glory

I walk where reason dies in flame
Where chaos screams the victor’s name
Steel and bone, my sacred sound
Where mercy bleeds into the ground

They pray for peace but raise the blade
And I arrive when debts are paid

Blood for glory, war is divine
Every scream and shattered spine
I am the wrath in every war cry
I live where brave men go to die

Athena speaks of tactics, law
But I bring war in tooth and claw
Let her whisper, let her scheme
I am the chaos in your dream

You call me monster, curse my name
Yet call on me when kingdoms flame

Blood for glory, war is divine
Every scream and shattered spine
I am the wrath in every war cry
I live where brave men go to die

I stood with Troy, I charged with Rome
My altar’s built from blood and bone
No hero rises without me—
I crown them through brutality

ATHENA (stern): “There is honor in restraint.”
ARES: “Then you’ve never tasted war’s true paint.”

Blood for glory, war is divine
Every scream and shattered spine
I am the wrath in every war cry
I live where brave men go to die

So march, my children, and never mourn—
The god of war was battle-born
