    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Golden Plague" explores the dual nature of Apollo—brilliant and beautiful, yet dangerous and vengeful. This song tells of the god who rides the sun across the sky, sings with divine artistry, and delivers prophecy, healing, and ruin. Drawing from myths like the Trojan War and his cursed blessing to Cassandra, Apollo's light is not always salvation—it’s judgment.</p>
<p>Apollo is one of the most powerful and complex Olympians. He governs music, healing, truth, prophecy, plague, and the sun. Twin brother to Artemis, Apollo wields both a golden lyre and a silver bow. He is revered as the ideal of youthful beauty and order, but he is equally known for bringing swift vengeance when dishonored.</p>

Apollo: Golden Plague

I ride the dawn on burning wheels
A chariot of fire that never kneels
I sing, I heal, I bless, I blind—
But cross my name, and death you’ll find

I shine with beauty, gold and grace
But stars can scorch what they embrace

Golden plague from the sky I fall
A god of light, a god of gall
My hymns can cure, my wrath can burn
You seek the sun, but never learn

The lyre weeps and arrows fly
I hear the prayers, but I decide
For every truth the Oracle told
A thousand tombs lie stiff and cold

They call me bright, they beg for peace
But I’m the silence when songs cease

Golden plague from the sky I fall
A god of light, a god of gall
My hymns can cure, my wrath can burn
You seek the sun, but never learn

Troy remembers every breath
My bow sang out the song of death
I guided kings, I cursed them too—
The future bends when I will truth through

“I gave you sight, but not belief!”
“A gift misused brings only grief.”

Golden plague from the sky I fall
A god of light, a god of gall
My hymns can cure, my wrath can burn
You seek the sun, but never learn

So raise your eyes and curse your fate—
The sun you love is just my hate
    </pre>
