    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Justice with a Blade" gives voice to Nemesis, the relentless force of divine retribution. This song captures the silent, calculating vengeance of the goddess who punishes hubris and restores balance to the moral order. She does not act out of rage, but necessity—ensuring that no injustice goes unanswered, and no excessive pride remains unchecked.</p>
<p>Nemesis is the Greek goddess of retribution, balance, and vengeance. She punishes arrogance against the gods (hubris), delivers fate, and ensures that excessive fortune is countered with correction. Represented with a sword and scales, Nemesis is feared by mortals and respected even among gods. She is the embodiment of cosmic balance and karmic justice.</p>

Nemesis: Justice with a Blade

You climb too high, you rise too fast
But justice waits, and pride won’t last
I walk in silence, scale in hand
To weigh the soul against its brand

No throne too tall, no deed too small
My name is whispered in your fall

Justice with a blade, calm and cold
I balance fate in blood and gold
I am the line you dare not cross
The hand that answers gain with loss

You mock the weak, you praise the sly
But hubris burns beneath my eye
I give no warning, sign, or plea—
I bring what’s earned, not what you see

The loudest lords, the cruelest kings
All pay the price my silence brings

Justice with a blade, calm and cold
I balance fate in blood and gold
I am the line you dare not cross
The hand that answers gain with loss

I’ve watched gods falter, mortals fall
No cry can bend the ancient law
You cannot beg, you cannot buy
What waits beneath the vengeful sky

“You decide who breaks, who thrives.”
“And I decide what still survives.”

Justice with a blade, calm and cold
I balance fate in blood and gold
I am the line you dare not cross
The hand that answers gain with loss

So when you rise, remember me—
The shadow trailing victory
    </pre>
