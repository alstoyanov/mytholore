    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
      The Sixth Labor of Hercules was to slay the Stymphalian Birds, a dangerous flock of aggressive, man-eating birds with metallic feathers that could be launched like arrows. These birds lived near a lake in the Stymphalian region. To defeat them, Hercules was given a rattle by the goddess Athena to make the birds take flight. Once they were airborne, Hercules used his bow and arrows to shoot them down, with some legends also suggesting he used a slingshot or his club to kill them. This labor showcased both his strategic thinking and his deadly accuracy

    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
      Feathers of Death
      
      From the shadows, they take flight,
      Wings like steel, they cut the night.
      Eyes like fire, beaks of doom,
      The storm has come, the air is tomb.

      "With this rattle, call the swarm,
      Bring them forth in violent form."
      "Strike with speed, strike with might,
      End this terror, end this fight."

      Feathers of death, they fill the sky,
      But I will fight, I will not die!
      With bow and aim, I take the flight,
      Strike them down, free the night! 

      They screech like demons, dark as fate,
      Their shadows cast a deadly weight.
      With every flight, a deadly rain,
      But I will bring their fall in pain.

      The sky is filled with screams and rage,
      But I will close this bloody cage.
      With arrows swift and heart unbowed,
      I bring them down, the dead will crowd.

      Feathers of death, they fill the sky,
      But I will fight, I will not die!
      With bow and aim, I take the flight,
      Strike them down, free the night!

      "The birds are slain, the dark is gone,
      Another labor, another dawn..."
