    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The Tenth Labor of Hercules was to steal the cattle of Geryon, a three-bodied giant who lived on the island of Erytheia in the far west. Geryon owned a herd of magnificent red cattle that were guarded by two fierce-headed dogs and his herdsman, Eurytion.
    <p>Hercules had to face numerous challenges during this labor, including crossing the desert, battling Geryon’s fierce creatures, and eventually confronting Geryon himself. After a fierce battle, Hercules defeated the three-bodied giant by striking him with arrows dipped in the poison of the Hydra. He then took the cattle and began the long journey back. Along the way, he was forced to fend off further attacks and even kill Eurytion, the herdsman.</p>
    <p>Hercules finally delivered the cattle to King Eurystheus, who was not impressed by the great effort and triumph, dismissing the feat as just another labor. However, this labor demonstrated Hercules' endurance, cunning, and ability to overcome divine obstacles.</p>

      Cattle of the Crimson Sun

      Far beyond the western land,
      Where oceans meet the sky and sand,
      A crimson herd, divine and rare,
      Guarded by a giant’s glare!

      Through fire and storm, I ride alone,
      With strength of gods, with flesh and bone!
      No chains shall bind, no fear shall grow,
      This sacred herd, I will bestow!

      "Who dares to tread upon my land?!"
      "Your blood shall stain the golden sand!"
      "With threefold might, I strike you down,"
      "Your soul shall drown in shadows bound!"

      Blades will clash beneath the sun,
      A hero stands, the war’s begun!
      Through gods and kings, my fate is sworn,
      The crimson herd shall be reborn!

      Swords collide, the earth is torn,
      A giant falls, his legend mourned!
      Three heads fall, three hearts fade,
      But victory comes with blood and blade!

      Across the world, through gods' command,
      The crimson beasts now walk the land.
      A king awaits, a task complete,
      Yet still my soul knows no retreat.

      Blades have clashed beneath the sun,
      A hero stands, the war is won!
      Through gods and kings, my fate is sworn,
      Yet trials rise and more are born!

      "A hero’s path, forever torn,
      Through labors dark, through fate reborn..."
    </pre>
