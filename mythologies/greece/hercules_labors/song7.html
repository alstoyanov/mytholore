    <h2>Story</h2>
    
    <p>The Seventh Labor of Hercules was to capture the Cretan Bull, a mighty beast that ravaged the island of Crete. The bull was said to have been sent by Poseidon and was originally meant for King Minos to sacrifice, but Minos kept it, angering the god. The bull became wild, breathing fire and destroying fields and villages.</p>
    <p>Hercules wrestled the beast with his bare hands, using his immense strength to subdue it. After capturing it, he brought it back to King Eurystheus, who, terrified, released it into the wild, where it later caused more chaos in Greece. This labor showcased Hercules' brute strength and fearless determination.    </p>

      Wrath of the Cretan Bull

      From the halls of Minosâ€™ throne,
      A beast of fire stands alone.
      Born of gods, a curse untamed,
      Thunder roars, it knows no chains!

      Hooves like thunder, eyes like flame,
      A storm of rage, a beast untamed!
      No blade can cut, no wall can stand,
      I face the beast with mortal hands!

      "Run and hide, the bull will reign,
      A tide of ruin, endless pain!"
      "None can break the fireâ€™s hold,
      Its wrath is strong, its heart is cold!"

      ðŸ”¥ Face the beast, embrace the storm,
      Through dust and fire, I take its form!
      Through endless night, through pain and war,
      I claim the beast forevermore! ðŸ”¥

      I am fury, I am flame,
      No man shall ever call my name!
      Through shattered fields, my wrath will burn,
      None shall tame, none shall return!

      No chains, no blade, just mortal might,
      With hands of steel, I end this fight!
      Your rage is mine, your fire fades,
      Now kneel before the hand of fate!

      ðŸ”¥ Face the beast, embrace the storm,
      Through dust and fire, I take its form!
      Through endless night, through pain and war,
      I claim the beast forevermore! ðŸ”¥

      "Tamed by strength, the beast is bound,
      A legend forged in battleâ€™s sound..."
