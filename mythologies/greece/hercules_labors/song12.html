    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The Twelfth Labor of Hercules was to bring Cerberus, the three-headed guard dog of the Underworld, to King Eurystheus. Cerberus was a terrifying, monstrous creature that prevented souls from escaping the Underworld.</p>
    <p>Hercules descended into the realm of Hades, where he sought permission from Persephone and Hades to take Cerberus. To capture the beast, Hercules had to subdue him without weapons, relying on his immense strength and courage. After a fierce struggle, Hercules managed to drag Cerberus to the mortal world, where Eurystheus, terrified by the sight of the beast, ordered him to return it to the Underworld.</p>
    <p>This final labor tested Hercules' bravery, determination, and physical prowess, and marked the completion of his legendary twelve labors.</p>

      Cerberus Unbound

      Beyond the gates where shadows dwell,
      Lies the realm where damned souls yell,
      The land of death, the king of fear,
      Cerberus waits, his breath draws near!

      Into the dark, I stride alone,
      Through rivers cold, through lands unknown.
      The beast of three, with fiery breath,
      Shall feel my might, not mercy, death!

      "You seek my chains, my hellish might,
      None shall enter the realm of night!"
      "My teeth shall rip, my claws will tear,
      The gates of hell will swallow you there!"

      ðŸ”¥ Through the depths of hell, I march with fate,
      To face the beast, to seal his fate!
      Cerberus, your jaws shall cease to bite,
      I claim the prize, I claim the fight! ðŸ”¥

      Three heads snap, three mouths roar,
      The Underworld trembles, I strike the floor!
      No weapon drawn, no steel to guide,
      But strength of heart and endless pride!

      With hands of steel, I hold the beast,
      The Underworldâ€™s fury, now deceased.
      The heads are still, the chains now bind,
      The hellish dog, now left behind!

      ðŸ”¥ Through the depths of hell, I march with fate,
      To face the beast, to seal his fate!
      Cerberus, your jaws shall cease to bite,
      I claim the prize, I claim the fight! ðŸ”¥

      "The dog now tamed, the gates of doom,
      Open wide to mortalâ€™s tomb..."
    </pre>
