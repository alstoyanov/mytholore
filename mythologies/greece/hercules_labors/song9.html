    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The Ninth Labor of Heracles was to retrieve the war-belt of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons, which had been a gift from Ares. When Heracles arrived, Hippolyta was impressed by him and agreed to give him the girdle peacefully.</p>
    <p>However, Hera intervened by spreading rumors that Heracles intended to abduct the queen. The Amazons attacked, and in the ensuing battle Heracles killed Hippolyta (in some versions) before taking the girdle. He returned it to Eurystheus, completing the labor, though what could have been a peaceful exchange was turned into bloodshed by divine jealousy.</p>

      The Amazon Queen

      Beyond the waves, across the seas,
      A warrior queen with grace and steel.
      Her belt of gold, a prize so rare,
      But will she give it, will she dare?

      "Mighty son of Zeus, you stand,"
      "In lands where queens command the sands."
      "You seek my belt, a warrior’s claim,"
      "But honor guides the Amazon name!"

      "Trust is weakness, hear my call,"
      "Strike him down, let kingdoms fall!"
      "Betrayal feeds the fire bright,"
      "Now drown the world in endless fight!"

      Swords will clash, the sky will burn,
      Fate has turned, there’s no return!
      Through blood and war, I claim the fight,
      The queen will fall before my might! 

      Shields are shattered, cries of war,
      A pact was made, now drowned in gore.
      Through fire and steel, I carve my way,
      No peace remains, no words to say!

      The queen now falls, her breath runs thin,
      A battle lost, a hollow win.
      The gods have played their twisted game,
      And left behind a world in flames.

      Swords have clashed, the sky has burned,
      Fate has turned, there’s no return!
      Through blood and war, I claim the fight,
      But honor fades into the night... 

      "The warrior falls, the hero stands,
      A kingdom lost in shattered hands..."
    </pre>
