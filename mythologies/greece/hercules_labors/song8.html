    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The Eighth Labor of Hercules was to capture the Mares of Diomedes, a herd of man-eating, fire-breathing horses owned by the cruel King Diomedes of Thrace. These monstrous beasts were fed on human flesh and kept chained in iron.</p>
    <p>Hercules and his companions sailed to Thrace, where he defeated Diomedes in battle. In a cunning move, he fed the tyrant to his own horses, which calmed them enough for Hercules to bind and lead them away. He brought the tamed mares to King Eurystheus, who later set them free. According to legend, their descendants became the famous horses of Alexander the Great.</p>

      The Mares of War

      From Thrace they rise, a demonâ€™s breed,
      With fire-fed hunger, they storm and feed.
      Hooves like thunder, eyes like flame,
      No man alive can stake his claim!

      Dark winds howl, the earth is torn,
      The mares of war, in blood they're born!
      Their teeth are blades, their breath is fire,
      To break their chains is my desire!

      "No sword can tame their savage bite,
      Theyâ€™ll feast on flesh before the night!"
      "Turn away, donâ€™t test your fate,
      Their hunger never satiates!"

      ðŸ”¥ Ride the storm, face the flame,
      Strike the tyrant, end his reign!
      Through blood and war, I claim the fight,
      The beasts shall kneel before my might! ðŸ”¥

      "Foolish hero, hear my call,
      These beasts are mine, theyâ€™ll see you fall!"
      "Their hunger grows, they scent your fear,
      Your fate is sealedâ€”your end is near!"

      Now your master lies in chains,
      His life consumed, his kingdom wanes.
      The mares now bow, their hunger tamed,
      Through iron will, their souls reclaimed!

      ðŸ”¥ Ride the storm, face the flame,
      Strike the tyrant, end his reign!
      Through blood and war, I claim the fight,
      The beasts shall kneel before my might! ðŸ”¥

      "Bound no more by cruel command,
      A heroâ€™s will has freed the land..."      
    </pre>
