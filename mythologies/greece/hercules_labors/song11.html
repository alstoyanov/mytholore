    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The Eleventh Labor of Hercules was to steal the Golden Apples of the Hesperides, which were guarded by the Hesperides, nymphs who lived in a magical garden at the edge of the world. The apples were a gift from Gaia to Hera and granted immortality.</p>
    <p>The task proved to be one of the most challenging, as the garden was heavily protected, not just by the nymphs, but also by the hundred-headed dragon, Ladon, and Atlas, the Titan who held the heavens on his shoulders. Hercules, after navigating many obstacles, tricked Atlas into taking back the heavens so that he could retrieve the apples. In the end, Hercules claimed the apples, completing the labor, though it was through a mixture of strength, wisdom, and cleverness.</p>

      The Apples of Immortality

      Far beyond the mortal realms,
      Lies a garden of divine light,
      Golden apples, fruit of gods,
      Wrought in ancient, endless night.

      I journey forth, across the seas,
      To find the grove of golden trees!
      No god, no titan shall defy,
      The will of Hercules, I rise!

      "You seek the fruit of endless life,
      But not all quests come without strife.
      The gardenâ€™s curse is steeped in shade,
      And even gods may feel betrayed."

      ðŸ”¥ Through shadowed lands, across the sky,
      Iâ€™ll reach the stars before I die!
      The apples shine with gold divine,
      And I will claim them, they are mine! ðŸ”¥

      "I hold the heavens in my grasp,"
      "While you seek apples, worn and asked."
      "But I shall trade, a mighty weight,"
      "For this labor sealed by fate."

      I take your weight, the sky I hold,
      Your burdenâ€™s felt, your tale is old.
      The apples gleam, within my sight,
      I claim them now, with will and might!

      ðŸ”¥ Through shadowed lands, across the sky,
      Iâ€™ve reached the stars and touched the light!
      The apples shine with gold divine,
      And I have claimed them, they are mine! ðŸ”¥

      "The garden lost, the apples claimed,
      A heroâ€™s strength, the world proclaimed..."
