    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>The Second Labor of Heracles (Hercules in Roman tradition) was the slaying of the Lernaean Hydra, a monstrous, serpent-like creature that dwelled in the swamps near the city of Lerna in the Argolid.</p>
<p>The Hydra was no ordinary beast:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It had multiple heads (accounts vary, usually nine), and whenever one was cut off, two more would grow in its place.</p></li>
<li><p>Its breath and blood were poisonous, deadly to humans and animals alike.</p></li>
<li><p>A giant immortal head at the center made the Hydra seemingly impossible to kill.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Hercules set out to destroy it as commanded by King Eurystheus. He brought along his nephew Iolaus, who became crucial to the task. As Hercules chopped off each head, Iolaus cauterized the wounds with a burning brand (or torch), preventing new heads from sprouting. Finally, Hercules severed the immortal head and buried it under a heavy rock, ensuring it could never rise again.</p>
<p>After the battle, Hercules dipped his arrows in the Hydraâ€™s poisonous blood, which later played a major role in other myths. However, Eurystheus refused to count this labor as valid, claiming Hercules had received assistance from Iolaus.</p>

      Beast of Nemea

      Into the swamp, where darkness breathes,
      A thousand eyes beneath the leaves.
      The serpentâ€™s hiss, the air is thick,
      With venomous wrath, I must strike quick.

      "Heads of many, one shall grow,
      Strike with fire, or face the woe."
      "The beast you face, a thousandfold,
      Its might is endless, fierce and cold."

      ðŸ”¥ Hydraâ€™s wrath, serpentâ€™s might,
      Rise in fury, endless fight!
      Cut the heads, yet more arise,
      Strike them down, the beast shall die! ðŸ”¥

      Feel my fury, taste my breath,
      Each head a serpent, heralding death.
      Strike me down, I grow anew,
      Your fate is sealed, no escape for you!

      With firebrand, I sear the heads,
      They writhe and scream, their blood is red.
      But more will rise from the hellish deep,
      This battle calls for strength to keep!

      ðŸ”¥ Hydraâ€™s wrath, serpentâ€™s might,
      Rise in fury, endless fight!
      Cut the heads, yet more arise,
      Strike them down, the beast shall die! ðŸ”¥
      
      ðŸ”¥ Hydraâ€™s wrath, serpentâ€™s might,
      Rise in fury, endless fight!
      Cut the heads, yet more arise,
      Strike them down, the beast shall die! ðŸ”¥

      "With fireâ€™s wrath, the beast is slain,
      The Hydra falls, the victory gained."
      "Through trials many, the hero stands,
      Legends rise from his mighty hands..."
    </pre>
