    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
      The Fifth Labor of Hercules was to clean the Augean Stables, which had not been cleaned in years and were filled with an immense amount of dung from the thousands of cattle owned by King Augeas. The task seemed impossible due to the sheer volume of waste, but Hercules diverted two rivers, the Alpheus and Peneus, to wash the stables clean. He completed the labor in a single day, showcasing both his strength and his cleverness. Despite the impressive feat, King Augeas refused to honor his agreement, claiming the rivers did all the work and on top of this Hercules had been paid for the work.

      The River of Cleansing

      The king’s command, a filthy fate,
      A task so vile, it twists my hate.
      Mountains of waste, the stench so high,
      A god’s resolve, I’ll never die.
      
      "Impossible task, no mortal hand,
      Can cleanse this land or take a stand!"
      "The filth will stay, the stables reek,
      No strength can break this mountain’s peak!"
      
      With river’s might, the flood begins,
      Wash away the years of sin!
      Through the muck, I’ll carve my path,
      The river’s roar will make them last!
      
      Two rivers flow, their waters wide,
      Through earth and stone, they twist and slide.
      The filth will drown, the cattle freed,
      A king’s command, I take the lead.

      The rivers roar, the ground is clean,
      What once was foul, now pure, serene.
      In one swift day, I’ve turned the tide,
      The Augean stables now collide.
      
      With river’s might, the flood begins,
      Wash away the years of sin!
      Through the muck, I’ll carve my path,
      The river’s roar will make them last!
      
      "Through earth and stone, we carve a way,
      The river’s strength, the filth will sway."
      "By Hercules' hand, this task is done,
      The filth is gone, the day is won!"
      
      "Through water’s flow and strength untold,
      The legend grows, the story bold..."
