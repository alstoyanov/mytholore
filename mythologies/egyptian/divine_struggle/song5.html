    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>The desert winds whisper of loss, love, and destiny. Scattered in the Sand is a haunting and powerful ballad inspired by Isis’s desperate journey to reclaim Osiris after his body is torn apart and hidden across Egypt. Through the shifting sands and endless night, she refuses to surrender—piecing together what fate has broken.</p>
<p>With deep percussion, ghostly choirs, and sorrowful strings, this song captures grief, determination, and the power of love defying death. It is a story of devotion, where Isis walks alone through darkness, guided only by the echoes of her lost king.</p>
<p>Inspired by the Egyptian myth of Osiris and Isis, where Seth’s betrayal scatters Osiris’s body across the land. Refusing to accept fate, Isis embarks on a relentless quest to gather the pieces, preparing for a resurrection that will shake the heavens.</p>

Scattered in the sand

🌙 Shadows rise, the night is cold,
The desert whispers stories old.
His name is lost, the stars won’t guide,
Yet love still burns, it won’t subside.

💔 One by one, the echoes fade,
Buried deep where shadows lay.
Yet piece by piece, through dust and time,
I will bring back what once was mine.

🔥 Scattered in the sand, lost to time,
Fate has torn him, but he’s still mine.
Through endless night, I walk alone,
To find his flesh, to build his throne.

🏜 The river cries, the gods stand still,
Testing faith, breaking will.
But love won’t fade, and time won’t win,
I’ll call his soul, I’ll breathe again.

💔 One by one, the echoes fade,
Buried deep where shadows lay.
Yet piece by piece, through blood and sand,
I will rise—his fate in hand.

🔥 Scattered in the sand, lost to time,
Fate has torn him, but he’s still mine.
Through endless night, I walk alone,
To find his flesh, to build his throne.

✨ Bone and dust, flesh and stone,
The gods may hide, but I will know.
No hand of man, no tide of fate,
Can steal his soul or seal his fate.

The sand may shift, the stars may fall,
But love will rise above them all…
