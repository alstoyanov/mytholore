    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Step back into the legendary reign of Osiris, where Egypt flourished under wisdom, balance, and divine rule. Golden Age is a majestic and uplifting song that celebrates the prosperity of an era untouched by darkness, where the Nile flows freely, the temples rise high, and the people live in harmony under the gods' favor.</p>
<p>This track captures the grandeur and serenity of Osiris’s rule, blending regal orchestration, ethereal choral harmonies, and rich melodies to paint a vivid picture of a golden civilization at its peak. But even in paradise, the winds of fate whisper of a coming storm...</p>

Golden Age

Through golden fields where the river flows,
A kingdom rises, the sun bestows.
Osiris reigns, the land is bright,
Bathed in Ra’s eternal light.

Grain and harvest, strong and true,
The sky is clear, the waters blue.
Justice whispers through the breeze,
A world at peace, a land at ease.

Hail the king, the bringer of life,
Endless wisdom, guiding light.
Crowned in gold, the stars align,
In the golden age divine.

Temples rise, carved in stone,
Voices echo, gods have shown.
He speaks with grace, his hand is kind,
The fate of men in balance aligned.

Grain and harvest, strong and true,
The sky is clear, the waters blue.
Justice whispers through the breeze,
A world at peace, a land at ease.

Hail the king, the bringer of life,
Endless wisdom, guiding light.
Crowned in gold, the stars align,
In the golden age divine.

But shadows move beyond the sand,
Jealous hearts, a twisted hand.
Yet for now, let time stand tall,
Before the night begins to fall…

The river sings, the temples shine,
Echoing through endless time.
The golden age, so bright, so free,
A whispered song in history.
