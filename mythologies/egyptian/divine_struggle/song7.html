    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>From the ashes of betrayal, beneath the moonlit sands, a new destiny awakens. Falcon’s Birth is a majestic and powerful anthem, telling the story of Horus—the divine son of Isis and Osiris—born to reclaim his father’s throne and restore balance to Egypt. His birth is not just a moment, but a prophecy fulfilled, as the winds carry whispers of war and fate prepares to rise.</p>
<p>With thundering war drums, soaring choirs, and mystical flutes, this song embodies power, destiny, and the spirit of rebirth. A story of vengeance and divine right, where the falcon prince is born beneath the stars, ready to challenge the darkness.</p>
<p>Inspired by the Egyptian myth of Horus, born to avenge Osiris and challenge the rule of Seth. As the son of the sky, his wings stretch across the horizon, and his rise is foretold in the constellations. He is the light after the storm, the dawn after the longest night.</p>

Falcon’s Birth

Beneath the moon, the stars align,
A whispered name through space and time.
The river hums, the desert breathes,
A fate foretold upon the breeze.

The falcon wakes, his wings unfold,
A child of light, a tale retold.
Through golden sands, through shadow’s veil,
The gods have written his holy trail.

Born of magic, born of fire,
He will rise, the winds conspire.
Through the storm, through the fight,
The falcon soars into the light.

The dawn ignites the temple walls,
A mother’s voice, the heavens call.
His father’s name still lingers here,
A whispered vow, a fate sincere.

The falcon wakes, his wings unfold,
A child of light, a tale retold.
Through golden sands, through shadow’s veil,
The gods have written his holy trail.

Born of magic, born of fire,
He will rise, the winds conspire.
Through the storm, through the fight,
The falcon soars into the light.

The throne awaits, the war is near,
A kingdom lost in dust and fear.
Yet from the dark, his wings will break,
The dawn of kings, the storm will wake.

The falcon flies, the battle calls,
His shadow stretched on temple walls…
