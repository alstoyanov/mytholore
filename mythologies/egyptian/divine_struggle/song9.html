    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>The heavens tremble, the gods assemble, and the fate of Egypt hangs in the balance. Trial of the Gods is a cinematic and powerful anthem, telling the story of the final judgment of Horus and Seth, where the gods decide who will rule the throne of Osiris. Before the divine scales of Ma’at, truth will shine, and only one will emerge victorious.</p>
<p>With thundering war drums, ethereal choirs, and ancient Egyptian flutes, this song captures the tension, grandeur, and fate of the ultimate celestial trial. As Osiris, Anubis, and Ra watch in judgment, the sands of time shift, and destiny is sealed.</p>
<p>This song is inspired by the legendary trial of Horus and Seth, where the gods convene to decide the rightful ruler of Egypt. The heart is weighed against the feather of Ma’at, and only the worthy will rise. It is a tale of justice, divine law, and the final reckoning of an age-old conflict.</p>

Trial of the Gods

The throne room shakes, the stars align,
Twelve gods gathered, fate entwined.
Echoes rise, the judgment near,
Who will rule, who will disappear?

Heart weighed against the feather’s light,
Truth will shine, wrong or right.
The desert stills, the heavens cry,
One will rise, one will die.

Trial of the gods, judgment calls,
Who will stand, who will fall?
Thunder strikes, the scales decide,
The fate of Egypt turns the tide.

Seth stands bold, his voice is steel,
"The strong shall rule, the weak must kneel."
Horus speaks, his gaze like fire,
"The throne is mine, my fate is higher!"

Heart weighed against the feather’s light,
Truth will shine, wrong or right.
The desert stills, the heavens cry,
One will rise, one will die.

Trial of the gods, judgment calls,
Who will stand, who will fall?
Thunder strikes, the scales decide,
The fate of Egypt turns the tide.

Anubis waits, Ma’at stands tall,
Osiris speaks—the gods enthrall.
Lightning cracks, the final word,
The balance shifts, the fate is heard.

The sands still whisper of that day,
Where gods decreed, and one gave way…
