    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"King of the Underworld" is a dark and powerful tribute to Osiris, the ruler of Duat, the Egyptian underworld. This song tells the legendary story of his betrayal, resurrection, and eternal reign over the dead, capturing the mystery and majesty of one of Egypt’s most revered deities.</p>
<p>Once the rightful king of Egypt, Osiris was betrayed and murdered by his brother Seth, who sought to take the throne. His body was torn apart and scattered, but through the devotion of Isis, his wife and goddess of magic, he was resurrected. However, Osiris could no longer walk among the living—his fate was to rule the realm of the dead, Duat, where he became judge of souls and guardian of the afterlife.</p>
<p>In Egyptian belief, the souls of the dead journeyed to Osiris’s throne, where their hearts were weighed against the feather of Ma’at. If found pure, they were granted passage to Aaru, the paradise of eternal life—but if they failed, they were cast into darkness. Osiris, with his green skin symbolizing rebirth and eternal life, remained the final judge of all who passed beyond the mortal realm.</p>
<p>This song embodies the descent, resurrection, and eternal rule of Osiris. The thunderous drums and haunting chants echo the solemn halls of judgment, while the lyrics tell the story of fate, justice, and immortality. Osiris does not just rule the dead—he determines who may rise again and who will be forgotten in the sands of time.</p>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
King of the underworld

Fallen king, betrayed by blood
Cast beneath the rising flood
Through the veil, the echoes call
In shadowed halls, he stands tall

Golden crown, forged in fate
Judgment waits beyond the gate
Through endless night, his throne remains
The underworld calls his name

Ruler of the silent land
Heart weighed by the gods’ command
From death he rose, his fate unfurled
Osiris reigns, King of the Underworld

Sacred tomb, the sands conceal
Yet through the dark, his will is steel
The river flows, the stars align
Immortal king beyond all time

Golden crown, forged in fate
Judgment waits beyond the gate
Through endless night, his throne remains
The underworld calls his name

Ruler of the silent land
Heart weighed by the gods’ command
From death he rose, his fate unfurled
Osiris reigns, King of the Underworld

The scales are set, the truth is shown
He speaks the law from obsidian throne
Through sacred halls, the lost arrive
His voice will judge, his will survive

Golden crown, forged in fate
Judgment waits beyond the gate
Through endless night, his throne remains
The underworld calls his name

Ruler of the silent land
Heart weighed by the gods’ command
From death he rose, his fate unfurled
Osiris reigns, King of the Underworld

The gates swing wide, the judgment starts
He holds the truth within their hearts
In endless night, his kingdom lies
Where none return and time defies
    </pre>
