    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>The moon hangs low, the river whispers, and a queen mourns. Widow’s Lament is a sorrowful yet powerful ballad inspired by Isis’s grief and unwavering devotion after the betrayal and death of Osiris. Though the gods have turned away and the sands bury his name, love defies fate, and Isis will stop at nothing to bring him back.</p>
<p>With haunting harps, mournful strings, and ethereal choral echoes, this song captures Isis’s sorrow, strength, and magic as she searches for Osiris’s remains, weaving the first threads of resurrection. It is a song of grief, love, and destiny, carried by the winds of the desert.</p>
<p>This song is inspired by the Egyptian myth of Osiris and Isis, where Seth’s betrayal leaves Isis alone in grief. But in her mourning, she refuses to surrender, traveling across Egypt to find Osiris’s scattered body. It is the beginning of a journey that will defy gods and death itself.</p>

Widow’s Lament

The river weeps, the stars grow dim,
A kingdom lost, torn limb from limb.
His name still lingers in the wind,
But echoes fade where life had been.

I call his name, but silence grows,
The gods have turned, the cold wind blows.
Yet love defies the hands of fate,
I will not bow, I will not break.

Oh, my love, I search the tide,
Through endless sands where shadows hide.
The night is long, the road is wide,
But death won’t keep you from my side.

They carved his tomb in whispers deep,
A throne of dust where kings don’t sleep.
Yet I will roam through storm and sand,
To find his soul, to take his hand.

I call his name, but silence grows,
The gods have turned, the cold wind blows.
Yet love defies the hands of fate,
I will not bow, I will not break.

Oh, my love, I search the tide,
Through endless sands where shadows hide.
The night is long, the road is wide,
But death won’t keep you from my side.

I gather dust, I weave the sky,
With magic deep, I’ll make you rise.
No god nor man can steal away,
The love that lives beyond decay.

The river weeps, the stars still shine,
My love, I swear—you will be mine…
