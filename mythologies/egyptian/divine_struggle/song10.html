    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>In the heart of the storm, where fate and fury collide, the gods cast their final judgment. Eye of the Storm is a powerful and cinematic anthem inspired by the legendary trial of Horus and Seth, where the heavens tremble, and the destiny of Egypt is sealed.</p>
<p>With thundering war drums, haunting Egyptian flutes, and celestial choirs, this song captures the tension, chaos, and divine power of a battle not fought with weapons alone, but with truth, justice, and the will of the gods. As lightning flashes across the desert sky, the scales of Ma’at tip in one final decision—who will stand, and who will fall?</p>
<p>A storm of fate brews in the celestial halls as the gods weigh the hearts of warriors. Horus, the rightful heir, faces Seth, the usurper of the throne, in a trial where only one can emerge victorious. The balance of order and chaos rests in the hands of the divine.</p>
<p>This song is deeply inspired by ancient Egyptian mythology, specifically the legendary divine tribunal where the gods decide the rightful ruler of Egypt. The lyrics depict the intensity of this moment, as Horus, the falcon-headed god of kingship, stands before the celestial court while Seth, the god of storms and disorder, fights to hold onto power.</p>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
Eye of the Storm

Clouds ignite, the sky turns black
The gods bear witness, no turning back
Scales are set, the trial begins
Who will fall, and who will win

Lightning cracks, the desert shakes
A storm of fate, no escape
The eye is calm, the winds hold still
One last breath before the kill

Eye of the storm, silence calls
Who will stand? Who will fall?
Judgment strikes, the gods decide
The fate of Egypt turns the tide

Anubis waits, the scales align
Truth revealed beyond all time
Horus fights, his fire burns
Seth still rages, the darkness churns

Lightning cracks, the desert shakes
A storm of fate, no escape
The eye is calm, the winds hold still
One last breath before the kill

Eye of the storm, silence calls
Who will stand? Who will fall?
Judgment strikes, the gods decide
The fate of Egypt turns the tide

The storm now fades, the throne now claimed
The gods have spoken, Egypt’s name
    </pre>
