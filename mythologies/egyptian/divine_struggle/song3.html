    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>The night is silent, the halls are bright with celebration—but in the shadows, betrayal is set in motion. The Coffin’s Curse is a dark and dramatic song that tells the chilling tale of Seth’s ultimate act of treachery, trapping Osiris inside a coffin and casting him into the Nile. This is the moment where a golden age crumbles, where envy twists into murder, and where the whispers of fate seal a king’s doom.</p>
<p>This song is inspired by the Egyptian myth of Osiris’s betrayal, where Seth’s jealousy leads him to construct a beautifully crafted coffin, tricking Osiris into lying inside before sealing it shut and casting it into the Nile. It is the first act in a legendary cycle of death, resurrection, and revenge</p>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
The Coffin’s curse

A throne of gold, a kingdom bright,
Bathed in Ra’s eternal light.
Yet in the dark, a shadow creeps,
A serpent coils where wisdom sleeps.

A gift of wood, carved deep with lies,
A perfect shape, a king’s demise.
The gods look down, but none can see,
The treachery inside of me.

Lock the lid, seal the fate,
Let the river drown his name.
No more sun, no more throne,
The coffin drifts—his soul alone.

Laughter rings in halls of stone,
A brother’s hands have turned to bone.
The feast is done, the trap is laid,
A god betrayed, a debt unpaid.

A gift of wood, carved deep with lies,
A perfect shape, a king’s demise.
The gods look down, but none can see,
The treachery inside of me.

Lock the lid, seal the fate,
Let the river drown his name.
No more sun, no more throne,
The coffin drifts—his soul alone.

The stars above no longer shine.
The hands of fate are pulling tight,
The day has turned to endless night.

The coffin floats, the world stands still,
A king betrayed by envy’s will.
But fate is cruel, the gods will see,
That death is not the end for me
    </pre>
