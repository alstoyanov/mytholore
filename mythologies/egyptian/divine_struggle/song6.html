    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Beneath the silver glow of the ancient moon, magic stirs in the desert night. Magic of the Moon is a haunting and mystical ballad inspired by Isis’s sacred ritual to bring Osiris back to life. With the gods as silent witnesses and the stars as her only guide, she weaves a spell that defies fate itself.</p>
<p>Featuring celestial choirs, shimmering harps, and deep, hypnotic percussion, this song blends sorrow, longing, and divine power. It is a tale of unbreakable love, whispered through time by the winds of the Nile.</p>
<p>Inspired by the Egyptian legend of Isis and Osiris, where Isis, in the wake of betrayal, calls upon the power of the moon to reunite with her lost love. Through sacred spells and ancient rites, she weaves a path between life and death, refusing to let the gods decide her fate.</p>

Magic of the moon

Silver light on shifting sand,
The stars are drawn by fate’s own hand.
A whispered name, a secret spell,
A love too strong for time to quell.

The wind is calling, the echoes rise,
His spirit lingers in the skies.
I trace the stars, I call his name,
Through dust and death, love stays the same.
 
Magic of the moon, light the way,
Guide my hands, let night obey.
Through endless dark, through shifting time,
Love won’t break, his soul is mine.

The gods stand silent, cold and high,
Their judgment burns, but love won’t die.
With golden threads and whispered breath,
I weave him back, defying death.
 
The wind is calling, the echoes rise,
His spirit lingers in the skies.
I trace the stars, I call his name,
Through dust and death, love stays the same.

Magic of the moon, light the way,
Guide my hands, let night obey.
Through endless dark, through shifting time,
Love won’t break, his soul is mine.

Shadows dance, the river glows,
The spell is cast, the magic flows.
No chains of fate, no gods above,
Can steal away eternal love.

The night may fade, the dawn may rise,
But love still shines in moonlit skies…
