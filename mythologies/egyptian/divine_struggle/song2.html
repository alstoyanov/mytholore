    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Step into the sands of ancient Egypt and witness the rise of betrayal in Seth of the Desert, a haunting and mysterious song inspired by the legend of Osiris and Seth. As Seth's jealousy grows, the desert winds carry whispers of fate, ambition, and treachery, foreshadowing the fall of a golden age.</p>
<p>This track captures the brooding intensity of Seth's envy toward Osiris, blending deep percussion, eerie flutes, and haunting chants to create an atmosphere of impending doom. Feel the creeping tension as the sands shift and destiny unfolds.</p>

Whispers of the desert

The dunes stretch far, the sun burns red,
Shadows move where none have tread.
A brother watches, eyes like stone,
Silent rage, a heart alone.

The wind it speaks, it calls my name,
A voice of dust, a song of flame.
A throne too high, a crown too bright,
Buried beneath the endless night.

Oh, can you hear it?
The whispers of the desert sigh,
A storm is coming,
The gods have turned a blind eye.
Oh, can you feel it?
The shifting sands, the serpent’s grin,
The tide is turning,
Let the game of fate begin.

Golden temples, songs of praise,
Yet in the dark, a fire blazed.
His name is carved in stone so deep,
But even kings can fall asleep.

The wind it speaks, it calls my name,
A voice of dust, a song of flame.
A throne too high, a crown too bright,
Buried beneath the endless night.

Oh, can you hear it?
The whispers of the desert sigh,
A storm is coming,
The gods have turned a blind eye.
Oh, can you feel it?
The shifting sands, the serpent’s grin,
The tide is turning,
Let the game of fate begin.

The river runs, the stars still shine,
But the jackal walks between the lines.
A hand unseen, a seed is sown,
Tonight, a king will stand alone.

The whispers call, the winds still cry,
One must fall for one to rise.
    </pre>
