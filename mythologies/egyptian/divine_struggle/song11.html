    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>In the wake of war and divine judgment, Horus, the Falcon King, rises to claim his rightful place as ruler of Egypt. The Rise of the Falcon King is an epic anthem inspired by ancient Egyptian mythology, telling the legendary tale of how Horus, son of Osiris, overcame trials, faced the chaos of Seth, and fulfilled his destiny as Pharaoh of the gods and mortals alike.</p>
<p>After the murder of Osiris, the kingdom of Egypt fell into disorder under Seth, the god of chaos. But Osiris’s son, Horus, the falcon-headed god, was destined to restore order. His journey was marked by battles, betrayals, and divine trials, testing his strength, wisdom, and rightful claim to the throne.</p>
<p>The final confrontation came before the gods, where the scales of Ma’at weighed truth against deception. Horus, proving his worthiness, was declared the rightful king, bringing balance to the world once more. His ascension symbolized the triumph of order over chaos, a moment that shaped Egyptian kingship for eternity.</p>
<p>This song captures Horus’s struggle, his divine trials, and his moment of victory. The storm represents the battle, the dawn symbolizes his rise, and the gods’ judgment marks the final decree. Through soaring melodies, powerful drums, and ancient harmonies, this track brings the myth to life, evoking the grandeur of Egypt’s most legendary tale.</p>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
The Rise of the Falcon King

Born from vengeance, forged in fire
(Born from vengeance, forged in fire)
A kingdom lost, a fate desired
The blood of kings runs through his veins
(The blood of kings runs through his veins)
Through endless trials, the throne remains

Lightning strikes, the battle calls
The gods decide who stands or falls
The storm may rage, the winds may cry
But the falcon king will rise and fly

The sky is open, the path is clear
The throne awaits, the time is near
The night has passed, the dawn will bring
The rise of Egypt’s falcon king

The desert whispers, the river speaks
(The desert whispers, the river speaks)
The voice of ages, the past it keeps
The weight of destiny in his hands
(The weight of destiny in his hands)
To bring back order to these lands

Lightning strikes, the battle calls
The gods decide who stands or falls
The storm may rage, the winds may cry
But the falcon king will rise and fly

The sky is open, the path is clear
The throne awaits, the time is near
The night has passed, the dawn will bring
The rise of Egypt’s falcon king

The scales are balanced, the war is done
(The scales are balanced, the war is done)
The rightful ruler, the chosen one
The halls of Ra now call his name
(The halls of Ra now call his name)
The gods have spoken, he will reign

Lightning strikes, the battle calls
The gods decide who stands or falls
The storm may rage, the winds may cry
But the falcon king will rise and fly

The sky is open, the path is clear
The throne awaits, the time is near
The night has passed, the dawn will bring
The rise of Egypt’s falcon king
