    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>As the last battle begins, Odin rides to war, flanked by his loyal wolves, Geri and Freki. The storm of Ragnarök has arrived—the gods stand on the battlefield, knowing their fate is sealed. The sky is torn apart, fire rains from above, and the enemies of Asgard surge forward for the final clash. No god, no beast, no warrior will escape the jaws of destiny.</p>
<p>🔥 In Norse mythology, Geri and Freki are Odin’s two wolves, the ever-hungry beasts who follow him into battle. They symbolize the unrelenting hunger for war and the inevitable fate of all warriors. As Odin marches to his doom against Fenrir, the monstrous wolf destined to kill him, the howls of Geri and Freki echo through the battlefield—an omen of bloodshed, destruction, and the end of an age. 🔥</p>

The Howl of Geri and Freki

The skies are torn, the world ignites,
The gates of fate swing open wide.
The horns have called, the warriors rise,
One last march to meet our time.

🔥 To Valhalla! We stand as one!
To Valhalla! The end has come! 🔥

🐺 The howl of Geri, the howl of Freki,
Echoes loud through battle’s fury.
The wolves of war, they tear and feast,
Upon the flesh of gods and beasts. 🐺

The storm is here, the earth will break,
No turning back, no last escape.
With spear in hand, I carve the path,
A god must die with wrath intact!

🔥 To Valhalla! We stand as one!
To Valhalla! The end has come! 🔥

🐺 The howl of Geri, the howl of Freki,
Echoes loud through battle’s fury.
The wolves of war, they tear and feast,
Upon the flesh of gods and beasts. 🐺

The fires rise, the sky is torn,
A battle lost, a world reborn.
The howl of wolves, the clash of steel,
The fate of gods is now revealed…
