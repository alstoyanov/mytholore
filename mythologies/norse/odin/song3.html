    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>“I know that I hung on a wind-swept tree, nine long nights, wounded with spear, given to Odin, myself to myself…” – Hávamál 138</p>
<p>Odin, the Allfather, endured nine nights of agony upon Yggdrasil, the World Tree, sacrificing himself to himself to unlock the secrets of the runes—the symbols of knowledge, fate, and power. Suspended between life and death, he bled into the roots of existence, staring into the abyss to grasp the wisdom that would shape gods and men.</p>
<p>"Nine Nights on the Tree" brings this mythic trial to life with thunderous riffs, haunting Viking chants, and bone-crushing intensity, capturing the pain and triumph of Odin’s sacrifice. The runes were not gifted; they were won through suffering, and their power would echo into Ragnarök.</p>

Nine Nights on the Tree

Bound in silence, cold winds cry,
Hung between the earth and sky.
No hand to help, no breath to save,
I bleed into the roots—my grave.

Through the void, the whispers call,
Runes of fate, I see them all.

Nine nights I fall, yet never die,
Through death and pain, I claim the sky.
Carved in blood, the runes are mine,
The price of wisdom—etched in time.

The branches groan, the ravens weep,
The void beneath is dark and deep.
No crown, no throne, no guiding light,
Only shadows birthed from night.

Through the void, the whispers call,
Runes of fate, I see them all.

Nine nights I fall, yet never die,
Through death and pain, I claim the sky.
Carved in blood, the runes are mine,
The price of wisdom—etched in time.

From agony, the truth is born,
A world reshaped, the veil is torn.
The words of gods now burn in me,
Bound in death, yet finally free.

Cold winds cry…
Yet I rise.
    </pre>
