    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Through silver tongue and lover’s lie, the stolen mead will touch the sky." ⚔️</p>
<p>In the depths of a mountain fortress, guarded by the giant Suttungr, lies the Mead of Poetry—a sacred elixir granting wisdom, inspiration, and the power of verse. To claim it, Odin, the trickster and seeker of knowledge, must deceive Gunnlöð, the maiden who watches over the mead. For three nights, he woos her, weaving a web of passion and deception. But when dawn breaks, his true nature is revealed—he drinks the mead, transforms into an eagle, and soars toward Asgard, leaving behind a love betrayed and a fate forever changed.</p>

The Mead and the Maiden

Through shadowed hills and frozen stone,
I ride where whispered secrets roam.
The gods have spoken, the price is set,
Three nights sworn, the mead beget.

Golden voice, a siren’s call,
Bound in chains, yet standing tall.

Drink deep, the fire flows,
Wisdom carved where no man knows.
Through silver tongue and lover’s lie,
The stolen mead will touch the sky.

Her eyes like embers, burning bright,
A storm of gold in endless night.
A kiss of sorrow, a touch of fate,
The gods must lie, the gods must take.

Golden voice, a siren’s call,
Bound in chains, yet standing tall.

Drink deep, the fire flows,
Wisdom carved where no man knows.
Through silver tongue and lover’s lie,
The stolen mead will touch the sky.

Three drops fall, the pact is torn,
Through eagle’s flight, the gods are sworn.
From sacred lips to battle cries,
The gift of verse will never die.

Golden voice, a siren’s call,
Bound in chains, yet standing tall.

Drink deep, the fire flows,
Wisdom carved where no man knows.
Through silver tongue and lover’s lie,
The stolen mead will touch the sky.

The fire flows… the fire flows…
The stolen mead will touch the sky.
