    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Odin, the Allfather, seeks the truth of Baldr’s fate. In his relentless pursuit of knowledge, he rides to the darkened realm of Hel and calls forth a völva (seeress) from the grave. She awakens from death’s cold embrace, bound by magic, to reveal the inevitable doom of the gods. Her voice is spectral, sorrowful, yet unyielding—foretelling the death of Baldr, the coming of Ragnarök, and the inescapable hand of fate.</p>
<p>In this symphonic black metal epic, Odin’s deep, commanding growls clash with the ethereal voice of the völva, capturing the duality of the living and the dead, the seeker and the oracle, the god and the grave. With haunting choirs, thunderous drums, and orchestral fury, "The Seeress Awakens" brings to life one of the darkest and most fateful prophecies in Norse mythology.</p>

The Seeress Awakens

Through midnight’s shroud, where shadows creep,
I ride alone where the fallen sleep.
Nine runes carved in frost and stone,
A whisper calls from death’s unknown.

Who disturbs my slumbered rest?
Whose voice calls through the veil of death?

The seeress wakes from death’s embrace,
Bound by fate, no time nor space.
Through shrouded sight, the end I see,
The weeping god, the felled ash tree.

Tell me now, no riddles weave,
What doom awaits, what webs deceive?
Baldr’s fate is veiled in night,
By whose hand will fall his light?

The mistletoe, so soft, so small,
Shall be the dart that slays them all.

The seeress wakes from death’s embrace,
Bound by fate, no time nor space.
Through shrouded sight, the end I see,
The weeping god, the felled ash tree.

I see the halls of Hel aglow,
A feast prepared for one below.
No power now can change his way,
The threads are spun, the Norns have swayed.

I curse the night, I curse the dream,
Yet fate remains—a silent scream…
    </pre>
