    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"He gave an eye, but gained the world." ⚔️</p>
<p>Step into the mythic realm with "The One-Eyed Seeker," a song inspired by Odin’s relentless pursuit of wisdom. From the storm-cloaked skies of Asgard to the shadowed roots of Yggdrasil, Odin wanders the Nine Realms in search of knowledge, power, and fate’s hidden truths.</p>
<p>This track brings to life one of the Allfather’s most legendary sacrifices—offering his eye to Mímir’s Well in exchange for the wisdom of the cosmos. But knowledge has a price, and Odin’s journey does not end there. Carving runes into reality, whispering to the dead, and walking the path of destiny, he is the eternal seeker of truth.</p>

The One-Eyed Seeker

Through the mist and storm I ride,
Cloaked in shadows, far and wide.
Ancient whispers call my name,
In the dark, I play the game.

Blood and silence, the price of sight,
I seek the truth beyond the night.

Wanderer, seeker, through fire and time,
Bearing the weight of fate’s design.
One-eyed god with hunger unchained,
Lost in the stars where knowledge remains.

One eye watches, one is lost,
Wisdom gained at endless cost.
Runes are carved in bone and stone,
I walk this path, but not alone.

Blood and silence, the price of sight,
I seek the truth beyond the night.

Wanderer, seeker, through fire and time,
Bearing the weight of fate’s design.
One-eyed god with hunger unchained,
Lost in the stars where knowledge remains.

The well is deep, the tree still stands,
I hear the call of distant lands.
A voice of fate, a song of pain,
The seeker walks, yet none remain.

Blood and silence, the price of sight,
I seek the truth beyond the night.

Wanderer, seeker, through fire and time,
Bearing the weight of fate’s design.
One-eyed god with hunger unchained,
Lost in the stars where knowledge remains.

Through the mist and storm I ride,
One eye open, still I guide…
    </pre>
