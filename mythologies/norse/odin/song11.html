    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>As the storm clouds gather and the echoes of fate resound, Odin, the Allfather, stands at the edge of destiny. He has long foreseen RagnarÃ¶k, the final battle that will bring about the end of gods and men alike. Though he is the master of wisdom, war, and fate, even he cannot escape what has been woven by the Norns.</p>
<p>ðŸ”¥ In Norse mythology, Odin is doomed to face the great wolf Fenrir, knowing he will fall in battle. "The War Godâ€™s Lament" captures the weight of his sorrowâ€”not from fear, but from the inescapable knowledge that all he has built will soon be reduced to ruin. The halls of Valhalla will be emptied, Asgard will crumble, and the age of gods will end. Yet, despite this, Odin marches forward, spear in hand, accepting his fate with honor. ðŸ”¥</p>

The War Godâ€™s Lament

The ravens return with tidings grim,
Ashes ride upon the wind.
I see the fire, the breaking dawn,
The time of gods, it wonâ€™t be long.

Fate has woven, the end is near,
Even kings must bow to fear.

ðŸ”¥ The gods will fall, the sky will burn,
The tides of war will not return.
No prayer can change what must be done,
I march to dieâ€”my fate has come. ðŸ”¥

Iâ€™ve walked the path, Iâ€™ve paid the cost,
For wisdom gained, for battles lost.
The spear is raised, the wolves draw near,
I stand alone, I feel no fear.

Fate has woven, the end is near,
Even kings must bow to fear.

ðŸ”¥ The gods will fall, the sky will burn,
The tides of war will not return.
No prayer can change what must be done,
I march to dieâ€”my fate has come. ðŸ”¥

Fate has woven, the end is near,
Even kings must bow to fear.

ðŸ”¥ The gods will fall, the sky will burn,
The tides of war will not return.
No prayer can change what must be done,
I march to dieâ€”my fate has come. ðŸ”¥

The ravens fly, they sing my name,
A warriorâ€™s death, an ending claimed.
The echoes fade, the dusk is doneâ€¦
The war godâ€™s lamentâ€¦ is sung.
    </pre>
