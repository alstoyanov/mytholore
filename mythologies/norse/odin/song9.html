    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>🔥 Odin walks the path of the dead. 🔥</p>
<p>In this haunting doom-laden odyssey, Odin, the Allfather, descends into Helheim, the dark and desolate realm of the dead, in search of forbidden knowledge. His journey is a confrontation with fate itself, as he seeks to learn if his beloved son, Baldr, can be returned from death. But Hel, the cold and merciless ruler of the underworld, offers only whispers of inevitability and sorrow.</p>
<p>☠️ Helheim is no place for gods. The land is shrouded in mist, where souls of the dishonored and forgotten drift like shadows, their voices lingering in the air like distant screams. Odin’s heavy, droning voice clashes against Hel’s ghostly whispers, a battle not of swords, but of truth—a truth that even a god cannot change.</p>

Echoes of Helheim

Shrouded paths of frozen stone,
Through gates of bone, I walk alone.
The air is still, the sky is dead,
Hel’s cold breath upon my head.

"No warmth, no light, no life remains,
Only echoes call your name..."

🔥 Helheim calls, the lost arise, 🔥
Shadows dance in hollow eyes.
No return, no dawn to see,
Only death remains with me.

Tell me, keeper of the slain,
Will my son rise once again?
Through veils of mist and rivers black,
I hear his voice—he won’t come back…

"Bound in fate, sealed in cold,
No god defies what time has told..."

🔥 Helheim calls, the lost arise, 🔥
Shadows dance in hollow eyes.
No return, no dawn to see,
Only death remains with me.

"Bound in fate, sealed in cold,
No god defies what time has told..."

🔥 Helheim calls, the lost arise, 🔥
Shadows dance in hollow eyes.
No return, no dawn to see,
Only death remains with me.

"The world will weep, the end draws near...
Go now, Father, your doom is here."

"No return, no dawn to see,
