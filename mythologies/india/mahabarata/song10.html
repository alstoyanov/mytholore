    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
One of the greatest yet most tragic figures of the Mahabharata, Karna was a warrior like no other, yet cursed from birth. This song tells the heart-wrenching tale of the lost son of Kunti, who was:<br /><br />
⚔️ A Warrior Without a Name:<br />
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
<li>Born of the Sun God, yet abandoned at birth.</li>
<li>Raised by charioteers, denied the right to be a Kshatriya (warrior caste).</li>
<li>Humiliated by Draupadi, insulted by the world—yet never bowed.</li>
  </ul>
<p>
⚔️ A Brother Without Knowing:<br />
</p>
  <ul>
<li>Unaware that his true brothers were the Pandavas, the very ones he was destined to fight.</li>
<li>Sworn to Duryodhana, the man who gave him a throne and friendship when no one else would.</li>
<li>Trapped by fate—honor or truth, blood or loyalty?</li>
  </ul>
<p>
⚔️ A Warrior Without Mercy:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Cursed by Parashurama—his divine knowledge would fail him when he needed it most.</li>
<li>Stripped of his divine armor by Indra, leaving him defenseless.</li>
<li>His chariot wheel sunk into the earth—the gods themselves conspired against him.</li>
<li>Struck down by Arjuna, as Krishna watched in silence.</li>
</ul>

Karna: The Tragic Son

Born beneath a cursed sun,
 A warrior’s blood, a stranger’s son.
 Cast away, the gods deceived,
 Yet fire in my veins still breathes.

"No name, no crown, no father’s grace,"
 "Bound to shadows, lost in fate’s embrace."

I am the outcast, the fallen heir,
 A king denied, yet none compare!
 Bound to oaths, to fate I kneel,
 A warrior forged in fire and steel!

A friend to kings, a rival’s bane,
 Yet my own blood denies my name.
 My honor sworn, my path unclear,
 Betrayed by fate, but not by fear!

"Dharma calls, the wheel turns fast,"
 "One final battle, one breath, my last."

I am the outcast, the fallen heir,
 A king denied, yet none compare!
 Bound to oaths, to fate I kneel,
 A warrior forged in fire and steel!

"A curse upon me, my armor torn,"
 "No chariot to ride, my fate is sworn!"
 "An arrow flies, the gods watch cold,"
 "Tell my mother… her son was bold!"

I was the outcast, the tragic son,
 A king denied, yet second to none!
 Bound to oaths, to fate I knelt,
 Yet fire and steel is all I felt…

 "An arrow flies, the gods watch cold,"
 "Tell my mother… her son was bold!" 
    </pre>
