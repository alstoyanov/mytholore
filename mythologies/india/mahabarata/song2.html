    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
Dive into the legend of Bhishma, the immortal warrior bound by an unbreakable vow. Born as the son of Ganga, he renounced his claim to the throne and swore a lifetime of celibacyâ€”an oath that shaped the destiny of the Kuru dynasty.<br /><br />
This song captures the tragedy, sacrifice, and unwavering duty of Bhishma, a warrior cursed to live until willed to die, fighting for a kingdom that would never be his. From his deadly vow to his final stand on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Bhishma remains one of the most haunting and powerful figures in Indian mythology.<br /><br />
ðŸ”± Who was Bhishma?<br />
    </p>
    <ul>
<li>The grand-uncle of both the Pandavas and Kauravas.</li>
<li>Took a terrible vow of celibacy, ensuring his fatherâ€™s marriage but dooming himself.</li>
<li>Fought on the side of the Kauravas due to his oath, even though he knew of their downfall.</li>
<li>Blessed with "Iccha Mrityu" (death by will), he lay on a bed of arrows, choosing the moment of his passing.</li>
    </ul>

The Oath of Bhishma

Born of a river, a warrior untamed,
 Bound by the blood of a dynasty named.
 A son of the Ganges, a god among men,
 Sworn to a path that none dare defend.

A crown forsaken, a life denied,
 A vow unbroken, though fate defied.
 Steel in my heart, ice in my veins,
 Dharmaâ€™s burden, an oath remains.

I stand unshaken, through fire and time,
 Bound to the throne, though never it's mine.
 No love, no heir, no kingdom to claim,
 I am Bhishma, I die in thy name.

Satyavatiâ€™s whispers, the kingdomâ€™s decree,
 The weight of a promise falls heavy on me.
 A warriorâ€™s fire, now frozen in stone,
 Condemned to protect, yet die all alone.

A crown forsaken, a life denied,
 A vow unbroken, though fate defied.
 Steel in my heart, ice in my veins,
 Dharmaâ€™s burden, an oath remains.

I stand unshaken, through fire and time,
 Bound to the throne, though never it's mine.
 No love, no heir, no kingdom to claim,
 I am Bhishma, I die in thy name.

The gods bear witness, the heavens cry,
 The river mourns but wonâ€™t ask why.
 For dutyâ€™s chains, I kneel in stone,
 My soul is mine, but my lifeâ€™s not my own.

I stand unshaken, through fire and time,
 Bound to the throne, though never it's mine.
 No love, no heir, no kingdom to claim,
 I am Bhishma, I die in thy name!

 For dutyâ€™s chains, I kneel in stone,
 My soul is mine, but my lifeâ€™s not my own.
