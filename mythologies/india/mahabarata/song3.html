    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most sinister betrayals in the Mahabharata, this song tells the tale of Duryodhana and Shakuni‚Äôs failed attempt to burn the Pandavas alive.<br /><br />
üè∞ The Conspiracy:
    </p>
    <ul>
<li>The Kauravas, fearing the Pandavas‚Äô strength, build a palace made of highly flammable lac (wax).</li>
<li>Shakuni‚Äôs deception ensures the Pandavas feel safe while secretly preparing their doom.</li>
<li>On a fateful night, the palace is set ablaze, meant to trap Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, and their mother Kunti.</li>
<li>But fate had other plans‚Äîthe Pandavas escape through an underground tunnel, while a decoy family perishes in their place.</li>
<li>Duryodhana celebrates, believing them dead‚Ä¶ but their vengeance will come.</li>
    </ul>

House of Lac

Built with oil, bound in sin,
 A house of gold, but death within.
 Drink the wine, breathe the air,
 Tonight, my rivals burn in despair!

"Smoke in the halls, shadows that creep,"
 "Whispers of murder, nightmares don‚Äôt sleep!"

Inferno‚Äôs rise, the traitors grin,
 Fire-fed walls, the game begins!
 Through the flames, through the dark,
 The Kuru blood is split apart!

Wake from the dream, the walls ignite,
 Fate is forged in embers bright.
 Through the tunnels, through the pain,
 We rise like ashes, we break the chains!

"Smoke in the halls, shadows that creep,"
 "Whispers of murder, nightmares don‚Äôt sleep!"

Inferno‚Äôs rise, the traitors grin,
 Fire-fed walls, the game begins!
 Through the flames, through the dark,
 The Kuru blood is split apart!

Through the tunnels of fate we crawl,
 Through the ashes, we hear them call.
 "We will return, we will arise,"
 "Duryodhana, your throne is lies!"

Inferno‚Äôs rise, the traitors grin,
 Fire-fed walls, the game begins!
 Through the flames, through the dark,
 The Kuru blood is split apart!

"We will return, we will arise,"
 "Duryodhana, your throne is lies!"
