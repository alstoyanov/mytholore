    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
 Among the most tragic and heroic moments in the Mahabharata, this song tells the story of Abhimanyu, the son of Arjuna, who fought alone against an army in the impenetrable Chakravyuha battle formation. Though he knew how to enter the labyrinth of death, he did not know the way out.<br /><br />
⚔️ The Tragic Fate of Abhimanyu:<br />
 </p>
 <ul>
<li> 16 years old, yet standing as a warrior among kings.</li>
<li>Deceived into battle, trapped within the Chakravyuha while his allies were kept away.</li>
<li>Seven Kaurava generals, including Karna, Drona, and Duryodhana, surrounded him, breaking the rules of honorable combat.</li>
<li>Despite being outnumbered, he fought like a god, cutting down warriors, smashing chariots, and breaking their lines.</li>
<li>But betrayal and exhaustion took their toll—his weapons shattered, his armor torn, and still, he fought on with fists and fury.</li>
<li>Spears rained down, swords struck deep—yet Abhimanyu died a warrior, unbowed, unbroken, undefeated in spirit.</li>
 </ul>

The Chakravyuha (Abhimanyu’s Last Stand)

The gates of war are open wide,
 A labyrinth forged in steel and pride.
 My father’s blood, my warrior’s fate,
 Through walls of death, I seal my state!

"Chakravyuha—no way back,"
 "Blades surround, the skies turn black!"

One against a thousand foes,
 Steel and fate, the circle grows!
 Cut me down, I’ll rise again,
 A warrior’s death, my final stand!

The traitors come, the cowards strike,
 Seven against one, no honor in sight!
 Yet my sword sings, my fury calls,
 If this be fate, let kingdoms fall!

"Chakravyuha—no escape,"
 "The wheel of fate, the gods await!"

One against a thousand foes,
 Steel and fate, the circle grows!
 Cut me down, I’ll rise again,
 A warrior’s death, my final stand!

"Father, forgive me, the dawn won’t rise,"
 "Yet through my blood, the fire survives!"
 "No death in vain, no warrior’s cries,"
 "The war is lost—but truth won’t die!"

One against a thousand foes,
 Steel and fate, the circle grows!
 Cut me down, I’ll rise again,
 A warrior’s death, my final stand!

"No death in vain, no warrior’s cries,"
 "The war is lost—but truth won’t die!"
