    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
      This song captures one of the most defining moments in the Mahabharata—the exile of the Pandavas and their burning vow of vengeance.
⚔️ The Story of Exile & Vengeance:
</p>
<ul>
<li>After being deceived in the game of dice, the Pandavas lose their kingdom, honor, and freedom.</li>
<li>Sent into twelve years of exile and one year of disguise, they are forced to live as outcasts, sharpening their rage for the inevitable war.</li>
<li>Draupadi, humiliated and unavenged, swears that she will not tie her hair until it is bathed in Dushasana’s blood.</li>
<li>Krishna, witnessing the depths of injustice, foretells a war that will drown the world in blood.</li>
<li>The Kurukshetra War is no longer a question of if—but when!
</ul>

Exile & Vengeance

Cast into shadows, kings torn down,
 Stripped of steel, of throne and crown.
 Ash and dust, the forest calls,
 But vengeance speaks—the heavens fall!

"Twelve years in darkness, one in disguise,"
 "When we return, the world will rise!"

Exiled, betrayed, but fire remains,
 Bound by wrath, we break our chains!
 The gods have spoken, the oath is sworn,
 Vengeance calls—the world will burn!

No warrior stood when my honor bled,
 No sword was drawn, no justice said.
 But time will turn, and debt is due,
 For war is fate—I swear to you!

"Twelve years in darkness, one in disguise,"
 "When we return, the world will rise!"

Exiled, betrayed, but fire remains,
 Bound by wrath, we break our chains!
 The gods have spoken, the oath is sworn,
 Vengeance calls—the world will burn!

"Blood shall wash the sins of kings,"
 "Dharma wields the cruelest sting."
 "A war will come, a reckoning near,"
 "A river of death—no soul is clear."

Exiled, betrayed, but fire remains,
 Bound by wrath, we break our chains!
 The gods have spoken, the oath is sworn,
 Vengeance calls—the world will burn!

 "A war will come, a reckoning near,"
 "A river of death—no soul is clear."
