    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most powerful and fiercely independent women in mythology, Draupadi was no ordinary princessâ€”she was born of fire, destined to be the queen of five warriors and the catalyst of the greatest war in history.<br /><br />
ðŸ”¥ The Prophecy of Fire:
    </p>
    <ul>
<li>Draupadi was not born from a motherâ€™s womb, but from a sacred fire ritual performed by King Drupada.</li>
<li>Her birth was foretold by the gods, marking her as the bringer of destiny and doom.</li>
<li>She was fated to marry five husbands, the Pandavas, and be the center of a cosmic battleâ€”the Kurukshetra War.</li>
<li>Her humiliation in the Kaurava court led to her legendary vow: "I will not tie my hair until it is bathed in the blood of Dushasana."</li>
    </ul>

The Bride of Fire

From embers untamed, from fire divine,
 A daughter was forged, a fate entwined.
 Born of the pyre, no motherâ€™s embrace,
 Destined for war, for kingdoms disgraced.

"A queen of five, a curse, a flame,"
 "A love divided, a war to claim!"

Bride of fire, forged in the storm,
 A shadowed fate, a world reborn.
 Cursed and chosen, the gods conspire,
 To bring the endâ€”The Bride of Fire!

From the sacred flames, I rise unbowed,
 No chains of fate shall pull me down.
 Though kings may fight, though gods decree,
 I am the storm, the fire is me!

"A queen of five, a curse, a flame,"
 "A love divided, a war to claim!"

Bride of fire, forged in the storm,
 A shadowed fate, a world reborn.
 Cursed and chosen, the gods conspire,
 To bring the endâ€”The Bride of Fire!

"A kingdom will fall, a warrior will rise,"
 "One womanâ€™s wrath shall darken the skies."
 "In blood and flame, the war is sown,"
 "But fate is mine, I walk alone."

Bride of fire, forged in the storm,
 A shadowed fate, a world reborn.
 Cursed and chosen, the gods conspire,
 To bring the endâ€”The Bride of Fire!

 "In blood and flame, the war is sown,"
 "But fate is mine, I walk alone."
