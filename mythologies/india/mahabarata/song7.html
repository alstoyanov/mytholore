    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
      The Mahabharataâ€™s most awaited momentâ€”the end of exile and the return of the rightful kings! This song captures the ferocity, honor, and unyielding spirit of the Kshatriya warrior class, as the Pandavas prepare to reclaim their destiny.<br /><br />
ðŸ”¥ The War Cry of the Forgotten Kings:<br />
    </p>
    <ul>
<li>After thirteen years of exile, the Pandavas emerge from the shadows, no longer wanderers but warriors reborn. </li>
<li>Yudhishthira, once bound by dharma, now claims his right to rule. </li>
<li>Bhima swears to break Duryodhanaâ€™s body as he once broke their spirit. </li>
<li>Arjuna, guided by Krishna, raises the divine Gandiva bowâ€”ready to unleash chaos.</li>
<li>Draupadi, still unavenged, stands as a queen whose fury cannot be denied. Krishnaâ€™s celestial prophecy echoesâ€”"A war shall come, and no soul shall escape its judgment!"</li>
    </ul>

The Return of the Kshatriya

The forest whispered, the fire remained,
 Years in the shadows, forged by pain.
 The wheel of fate turns once again,
 The sons of kings shall rise from flame!

"Dharma calls, the bloodline wakes,"
 "The lion roars, the kingdom shakes!"

We march as thunder, swords held high,
 A storm of justice, we claim the sky!
 The Kshatriya rises, fate is sworn,
 A kingdom lost shall be reborn!

No throne can hold a king in chains,
 No cowardâ€™s rule shall stake its claim!
 The debt of shame is paid in war,
 The reckoning comesâ€”we kneel no more!

"Dharma calls, the bloodline wakes,"
 "The lion roars, the kingdom shakes!"

We march as thunder, swords held high,
 A storm of justice, we claim the sky!
 The Kshatriya rises, fate is sworn,
 A kingdom lost shall be reborn!

"Steel shall clash, the earth shall burn,"
 "Kurukshetra calls, the tides will turn!"
 "No man shall stand untouched by war,"
 "Dharma reigns, and death is law!"

We march as thunder, swords held high,
 A storm of justice, we claim the sky!
 The Kshatriya rises, fate is sworn,
 A kingdom lost shall be reborn!

 "No man shall stand untouched by war,"
 "Dharma reigns, and death is law!"
