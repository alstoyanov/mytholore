    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
      The Mahabharataâ€™s most infamous moment, this song captures the betrayal, deception, and downfall of the Pandavas at the hands of Shakuni, the master manipulator.<br /><br />
ðŸ”¥ The Fatal Wager:<br />
  </p>
  <ul>
<li>In the royal court of Hastinapura, a game of dice is set between Yudhishthira (the righteous king) and Shakuni (the cunning mastermind).</li>
<li>Shakuniâ€™s loaded dice ensure Yudhishthira loses everythingâ€”his kingdom, his brothers, himself. </li>
<li>In a final, desperate wager, he stakes Draupadi, his wife, unknowingly inviting the greatest humiliation in history. </li>
<li>Draupadi is dragged into the court, insulted before kings and warriors, but she summons Krishna, who saves her honor. </li>
<li>With this act, the Kurukshetra War becomes inevitableâ€”retribution is coming!</li>
    </ul>

Game of Dice

The hall is silent, the dice are cast,
 A brotherâ€™s fate, a wager vast.
 Honor bound, yet blind to guile,
 A king undone by a serpentâ€™s smile.

"Fortune turns, a fickle friend,"
 "In ivory hands, the world will bend!"

Roll the bones, watch them fall,
 Kingdoms crumble at fortuneâ€™s call!
 Bound by fate, deceived by vice,
 The world is lostâ€”to a game of dice!

Ivory whispers, destiny sways,
 One by one, I take your days.
 Pawn to knight, the board is set,
 Your throne, your lifeâ€”place your bet!

"Fortune turns, a fickle friend,"
 "In ivory hands, the world will bend!"

Roll the bones, watch them fall,
 Kingdoms crumble at fortuneâ€™s call!
 Bound by fate, deceived by vice,
 The world is lostâ€”to a game of dice!

"Dragged before the court, my cries denied,"
 "No justice here, no god presides."
 "If no man stands, then hear my vow,"
 *"The price of shame is warâ€”prepare them now!"

Roll the bones, watch them fall,
 Kingdoms crumble at fortuneâ€™s call!
 Bound by fate, deceived by vice,
 The world is lostâ€”to a game of dice!

 "If no man stands, then hear my vow,"
 *"The price of shame is warâ€”prepare them now!"
