    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most haunting tales of the Mahabharata, this song tells the story of King Shantanu and Gangaâ€”a love bound by destiny, shattered by silence.<br /><br />
      ðŸ’§ The Tragedy of Shantanu:<br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The great King of the Kuru dynasty falls for Ganga, a celestial river goddess.</li>
      <li>She agrees to marry him, but only if he never questions her actions.</li>
      <li>One by one, she drowns their newborn sons in the river.</li>
      <li>When she tries to take their eighth child, Devavrata (later Bhishma), Shantanu breaks his vow and Ganga leaves him forever.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This song captures the pain of a father, the mystery of fate, and the sorrow of lost love. With a fusion of doom metal, orchestral grandeur, and Indian folk melodies, we bring to life the echoes of a river that still whispers of a love long lost.<br /><br />
      ðŸŒŠ Why did Ganga drown her own children?<br /><br />
      According to legend, they were celestial beings cursed to be born as mortals. Their fate was sealedâ€”to be freed by their motherâ€™s hands. Shantanuâ€™s love for Ganga turned to despair, and Bhishma, the last son, would later become one of the most legendary warriors of all time.

The Curse of King Shantanu

By the river's edge, in twilightâ€™s gleam,
 A goddess stood, like a fleeting dream.
 Eyes like the stars, voice soft as the tide,
 She whispered to me, "Take me as your bride."

"Love me forever, but never ask why,"
 A vow was made under heavens so high.
 Yet sorrow was woven in fateâ€™s cruel design,
 One by one, my sons left with the tide.

Drowned in the river, taken by night,
 Their voices are lost in the currentâ€™s might.
 Bound by silence, cursed by love,
 The heavens weep, but it's never enough.

Seven cries swallowed by the waves,
 Seven souls drift to watery graves.
 But when her hands took my final heir,
 I broke my silence, I gasped for air.

"You have spoken, the spell is undone,"
 She turned to the wind and carried my son.
 "Devavrata shall live, but I must depart,"
 The river still flows, but Iâ€™m left in the dark.

Drowned in the river, taken by night,
 Their voices are lost in the currentâ€™s might.
 Bound by silence, cursed by love,
 The heavens weep, but it's never enough.

"You swore to the sky, but broke it in tears,"
 "Love is fleeting, and time disappears."
 "Though I am gone, the curse shall remain,"
 "A father bereft, a kingdom in pain."

Drowned in the river, taken by night,
 Their voices are lost in the currentâ€™s might.
 Bound by silence, cursed by love,
 The heavens weep, but it's never enough.

 "Though I am gone, the curse shall remain,"
 "A father bereft, a kingdom in pain."
