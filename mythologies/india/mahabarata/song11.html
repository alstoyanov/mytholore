    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
  In the final moments of the Kurukshetra War, only Duryodhana remains, the once-mighty prince of the Kauravas. His army is gone, his allies have fallen, but his pride and defiance burn on.<br /><br />
⚔️ The Duel of Fate:<br />
 </p>
 <ul>
<li>With the war lost, Duryodhana flees to a lake, seeking refuge in its enchanted waters.</li>
<li>Bhima, his sworn enemy, calls him out for a final battle—a duel of maces, a test of strength!</li>
<li>The two warriors clash like titans, their strikes shaking the battlefield.</li>
 </ul>
<p>
⚔️ The Final Blow:<br />
 </p>
 <ul>
<li>Duryodhana fights with unmatched skill, pushing Bhima to his limits.</li>
<li>But Krishna reminds Bhima of Draupadi’s humiliation, the moment Duryodhana swore vengeance.</li>
<li>In a moment of divine intervention, Bhima breaks the rules of combat, striking Duryodhana below the waist—a dishonorable but fated blow!</li>
<li>As Duryodhana falls, he curses the Pandavas, warning that their victory is hollow.</li>
<li>He does not beg, he does not weep—he dies a king, undefeated in his pride.</li>
</ul>

The Mace of Bhima

Crowned in fire, bathed in war,
 A fallen kingdom, my time no more.
 Steel in hand, I face my doom,
 Yet the Kaurava blood shall never be consumed!

"Yuddha-dharma, the time is near,"
 "One shall stand, one disappear!"

Stand and fight! The gods decree!
 The mace of Bhima sets you free!
 Crushed in dust, the ground will shake,
 For kings will die, but fate won’t break!

The earth shall bear my dying breath,
 Yet no man shall sing my death!
 Strike me down, I’ll rise again,
 For kings may fall, but never bend!

"Dharma calls, the war is done,"
 "One last strike, the end has come!"

Stand and fight! The gods decree!
 The mace of Bhima sets you free!
 Crushed in dust, the ground will shake,
 For kings will die, but fate won’t break!

"Strike below, the law defied,"
 "A shattered throne, a shattered pride!"
 "Upon this land, my blood will stain,"
 "Yet my name shall not be slain!"

Stand and fight! The gods decree!
 The mace of Bhima sets you free!
 Crushed in dust, the ground will shake,
 For kings will die, but fate won’t break!

  "Upon this land, my blood will stain,"
 "Yet my name shall not be slain!"
