    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
At the end of the Mahabharata, after the war has ended and the world has changed, the Pandavas embark on their final journey—a pilgrimage to the Himalayas, where only the purest may enter heaven in their mortal form.<br />
⚔️ The Path of Dharma:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>One by one, Draupadi and his brothers fall, their sins catching up with them.</li>
<li>Only Yudhishthira remains, walking with a lone dog, his silent companion.</li>
</ul>
<p>
⚔️ The Test of Heaven:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Indra descends, offering Yudhishthira a place among the gods.</li>
<li>But one condition is set—he must leave the dog behind.</li>
<li>Yudhishthira refuses. He will not abandon loyalty, even for paradise.</li>
</ul>
<p>
⚔️ The Reward of Virtue:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>The dog reveals itself as Dharma, his divine father, testing his righteousness.</li>
<li>Yudhishthira transcends, entering heaven in his mortal form—the only king to do so.</li>
<li>Yet a final shocking revelation awaits—Duryodhana resides in heaven, while his brothers suffer in hell.</li>
<li>Will he accept heaven’s truth, or fight for justice even beyond death?</li>
</ul>

Heaven’s Gate

The wind calls forth, the peaks rise high,
 A road of sorrow beneath the sky.
 Through lands of silence, through time’s embrace,
 We march toward the final place.

"One by one, they fade away,"
 "Ashes lost in dust and clay."

Heaven’s Gate, I walk alone,
 Through fire and stone, my fate unknown!
 A throne of stars, a path untold,
 Will dharma shine, or leave me cold?

Draupadi’s breath, a whisper fades,
 Her love consumed by fate’s cruel blade.
 Bhima, Arjuna, shadows cast,
 Their voices call me from the past!

"One by one, they fade away,"
 "Ashes lost in dust and clay."

Heaven’s Gate, I walk alone,
 Through fire and stone, my fate unknown!
 A throne of stars, a path untold,
 Will dharma shine, or leave me cold?

"Come, O King, the throne awaits,"
 "Rise beyond these mortal gates!"
 "But the beast who walks beside,"
 "Must be left, cast aside!"

Heaven’s Gate, I will not leave,
 For love and truth, I still believe!
 A throne of stars, a fate untold,
 Yet without my soul, what’s heaven’s gold? 
    </pre>
