    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
The Bhagavad Gita is one of the most profound moments in world mythology and philosophy, where Arjuna, the greatest warrior of his time, faces a crisis of conscience. This song captures the agony of doubt, the call of destiny, and the wisdom of Krishna, who reveals the true nature of the soul, dharma, and cosmic order.<br /><br />
⚔️ The Dilemma of Arjuna:<br />
</p>
    <ul>
<li>Standing on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Arjuna sees his friends, teachers, and kin among the enemy ranks.</li>
<li>Paralyzed by doubt, he throws down his bow, refusing to fight.</li>
<li>Krishna, his divine charioteer, reveals the eternal truth—life and death are illusions, only duty remains.</li>
<li>In a blinding vision, Krishna reveals his Vishvarupa—the Universal Form, the destroyer of worlds, beyond time and fate.</li>
<li>Arjuna, now reborn in purpose, lifts his bow once more, ready to fulfill his role in destiny’s grand design.</li>
     </ul>

The Warrior’s Dilemma (Bhagavad Gita)

The war drums call, the moment nears,
 Yet my hands shake, my heart fears.
 Fathers, brothers, friends I know,
 How can I strike, bring death’s cold woe?

"Na jāyate mriyate vā kadāchin,"
 "The soul is eternal, beyond death’s skin!"

Stand and fight, this war is fate,
 Doubt is weakness—shed its weight!
 Your sword is dharma, your path is sworn,
 No soul is lost, none truly mourned!

The sky turns red, the winds stand still,
 The gods watch silent, bend to will.
 If all is written, what choice remains?
 Is this my duty, or just their chains?

"Karmanye vadhikaraste, ma phaleshu kadachana,"
 "Act with duty, not for gain—be free of desire’s chain!"

Stand and fight, this war is fate,
 Doubt is weakness—shed its weight!
 Your sword is dharma, your path is sworn,
 No soul is lost, none truly mourned!

"Behold my form, beyond all time,"
 "I am death, the fate divine!"
 "All who stand shall fall in turn,"
 "Arise, Arjuna—the world must burn!"

Stand and fight, the time is now,
 No more questions, take the vow!
 The wheel is turning, fate is sworn,
 A warrior’s soul, at last reborn!

  "I am death, the fate divine!"
 "All who stand shall fall in turn,"

    </pre>
