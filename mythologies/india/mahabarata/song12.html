    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
Ashwatthama. A name etched in fire and sorrow, a warrior whose vengeance damned him to eternal suffering. This song tells the haunting tale of the son of Drona, who, in the dark of night, sought revenge but instead earned an unbreakable curse.<br /><br />
⚔️ The Night of Slaughter:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>With his father slain by deceit, Ashwatthama was blinded by rage.</li>
<li>Under the cover of darkness, he entered the Pandava camp, slaughtering the sleeping sons of the five brothers—an act of cowardice, or divine retribution?</li>
<li>Draupadi wept, the heavens trembled, and the gods took notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  ⚔️ The Curse of Krishna:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Confronted by the Pandavas and Krishna, Ashwatthama unleashed the Brahmastra, a weapon of ultimate destruction.</li>
<li>Arjuna countered with his own divine missile, threatening to destroy the world.</li>
<li>Krishna commanded both warriors to withdraw their weapons, but Ashwatthama, driven by wrath, redirected his Brahmastra to Draupadi’s unborn grandson.</li>
<li>For this act, Krishna cursed him with eternal suffering—immortality without honor, a festering wound that would never heal.</li>
</ul>
 <p>
⚔️ The Eternal Wanderer:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Now, Ashwatthama roams the earth, his body decayed, his pain never-ending.</li>
<li>The world forgets his name, yet his curse remains, whispered in the winds of time.</li>
</ul>

The Ashes of the Night (Ashwatthama’s Curse)

The night burns cold, the stars weep red,
 A father slain, my vengeance fed.
 Through shadows deep, my blade did fall,
 Yet no gods heard my grief’s cruel call.

"Fallen warrior, no peace, no rest,"
 "Wander forever, a soul possessed."

Ashes of the night, cursed to roam,
 A warrior’s wrath, yet no throne!
 Blood on my hands, fate's cruel embrace,
 Doomed to the dark, time leaves no trace!

A blade in hand, I struck them all,
 The sons of kings, in death they fall.
 Yet in my wake, the gods arise,
 A fate unbroken, no sun, no skies!

"The mark of sin, the pain remains,"
 "No death shall come, forever chained!"

Ashes of the night, cursed to roam,
 A warrior’s wrath, yet no throne!
 Blood on my hands, fate’s cruel embrace,
 Doomed to the dark, time leaves no trace!

"No dawn shall rise, no end will find,"
 "The stars shall burn, yet I remain blind!"
 "Through endless time, through ages cold,"
 "I walk alone… my tale untold!"

Ashes of the night, cursed to roam,
 A warrior’s wrath, yet no throne!
 Blood on my hands, fate’s cruel embrace,
 Doomed to the dark, time leaves no trace!

"Through endless time, through ages cold,"
 "I walk alone… my tale untold!"
