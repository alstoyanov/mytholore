    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"The Bull of Heaven" is an epic metal track inspired by the Mesopotamian myth of Ishtar's wrath and the Bull of Heaven sent to punish Gilgamesh for rejecting her advances. The song narrates the arrival of the destructive beast, summoned by the goddess to wreak havoc on the earth and take down the mighty king of Uruk.</p>
<p>With thunderous metal riffs, the track builds the tension as the Bull of Heaven rampages through the land, striking fear into the hearts of all. However, the power of Gilgamesh and his companion Enkidu is not easily overcome. Together, they face the beast in a battle that will shake the heavens and earth.</p>

The Bull of Heaven

From the heavens above, the earth starts to quake,
A creature of wrath, the world it will shake.
The Bull of Heaven, in fury it roars,
A beast of destruction, the earth it will scorch.

Born of the stars, in anger it flies,
A terror unleashed, across the skies.

The Bull of Heaven, unchained and wild,
A force of nature, a beast so reviled.
With fire in its eyes, it charges the earth,
The gods have spoken, this is its birth.

Gilgamesh stands, with courage and pride,
But the Bull comes forth, with nowhere to hide.
Its hooves strike the ground, the heavens split wide,
As the battle rages, there’s nowhere to bide.
[Pre-Chorus (Male + Female)]
A roar like thunder, the sky is aflame,
The Bull of Heaven calls, no one’s the same.

The Bull of Heaven, unchained and wild,
A force of nature, a beast so reviled.
With fire in its eyes, it charges the earth,
The gods have spoken, this is its birth.

But the beast will fall, its fate is sealed,
In the face of heroes, its power is repealed.
Gilgamesh and Enkidu, together they fight,
To slay the beast, to put an end to the night.

The earth trembles, but the heroes stand tall,
For the Bull of Heaven will soon fall.

The Bull of Heaven, unchained and wild,
A force of nature, a beast so reviled.
With fire in its eyes, it charges the earth,
The gods have spoken, this is its birth.

A creature of the stars, unleashed by pride,
Its fury is endless, but it cannot hide.
Beneath the light of gods, it met its end,
For even the heavens cannot always transcend.

The Bull of Heaven, unchained and wild,
A force of nature, a beast so reviled.
With fire in its eyes, it charges the earth,
The gods have spoken, this is its birth.
