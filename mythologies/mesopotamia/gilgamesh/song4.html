    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Humbaba’s Curse" is a powerful metal track inspired by the ancient myth of Gilgamesh and his fateful encounter with Humbaba, the guardian of the Cedar Forest. In this epic tale, Gilgamesh and Enkidu defeat the mighty Humbaba, but their victory comes at a steep cost: a deadly curse cast by the guardian in his final moments. As the gods watch from above, the curse begins to unfold, promising eternal retribution.</p>
<p>This song captures the dark and brooding atmosphere of Humbaba’s curse, blending haunting melodies and intense metal riffs to illustrate the growing tension as Gilgamesh and Enkidu’s journey takes a darker turn. With both male and female vocals, the song contrasts the raw power and haunting fate that now hangs over the heroes as they face the consequences of their actions.</p>

Humbaba's Curse

In the shadows of the Cedar's towering might,
Humbaba stood, a terror in the night.
A beast of the forest, with eyes full of fire,
His roar shook the earth, his wrath took them higher.

But the kings of Uruk sought to claim the prize,
They raised their weapons, defying the skies.

Humbaba’s curse, a wrath in the air,
The gods' anger rages, they cannot forbear.
From the heart of the forest, the darkness will rise,
A fate so cruel, no man can disguise.

The battle was fierce, the blood stained the earth,
The guardian fell, revealing his worth.
But as life slipped away, the curse was cast,
A vengeance eternal, from the future and past.

The gods will take notice, their fury will grow,
For a death without honor is one they will know.

Humbaba’s curse, a wrath in the air,
The gods' anger rages, they cannot forbear.
From the heart of the forest, the darkness will rise,
A fate so cruel, no man can disguise.

Now Gilgamesh and Enkidu walk with fear,
The curse upon them, growing near.
Through their hearts, the shadow will crawl,
For no man escapes the gods' final call.
Pre-Chorus (Male + Female)]
Their journey awaits, their fate they will see,
For the curse of Humbaba is bound to be free.

Humbaba’s curse, a wrath in the air,
The gods' anger rages, they cannot forbear.
From the heart of the forest, the darkness will rise,
A fate so cruel, no man can disguise.

The gods are watching, their wrath on the rise,
A curse bound in shadow, beneath the dark skies.
No strength can stop it, no power will fight,
The curse of Humbaba will consume the night.

Humbaba’s curse, a wrath in the air,
The gods' anger rages, they cannot forbear.
From the heart of the forest, the darkness will rise,
A fate so cruel, no man can disguise.
