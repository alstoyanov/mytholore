    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
The Plant of Youth

A legend I seek, through mountains and sand,
A plant of eternal life, in the distant land.
For death stalks my steps, a shadow unseen,
But the Plant of Youth will grant me the dream.

I’ve traveled so far, to defy the end,
But even the gods cannot always defend.

The Plant of Youth, so pure and so bright,
A gift of the gods to restore my life.
It blooms in the darkness, a beacon of hope,
But is immortality worth the endless scope?

Through trials I’ve passed, through deserts so wide,
The plant lies ahead, on the other side.
The scent of youth fills the air so sweet,
But will it be mine, or shall it retreat?

I can feel its power, I can taste its grace,
But with this gift, what will I face?

The Plant of Youth, so pure and so bright,
A gift of the gods to restore my life.
It blooms in the darkness, a beacon of hope,
But is immortality worth the endless scope?

I grasp it tight, but fate takes its toll,
A serpent devours, and I lose control.
The plant slips away, as I watch it fade,
And the truth becomes clear, in the light and the shade.

Immortality, a fleeting dream,
Like sand through my fingers, it slips downstream.

The Plant of Youth, so pure and so bright,
A gift of the gods to restore my life.
It blooms in the darkness, a beacon of hope,
But is immortality worth the endless scope?

A gift too great, a price too steep,
The plant is lost, the dream we keep.
In the end, we must learn to let go,
For life is fleeting, like the river’s flow.

The Plant of Youth, so pure and so bright,
A gift of the gods to restore my life.
It blooms in the darkness, a beacon of hope,
But is immortality worth the endless scope?
