    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"King of Uruk" brings the ancient myth of Gilgamesh to life through the power of metal music. Drawing from the rich tapestry of Mesopotamian mythology, this track encapsulates the legendary strength, arrogance, and eventual self-awareness of Gilgamesh, the mighty king of Uruk. As he stands atop his kingdom, invincible and unmatched, his rule is challenged by forces beyond his control: the wrath of the gods and the rise of a powerful companion, Enkidu.</p>
<p>In the ancient city, Gilgamesh’s quest for glory and immortality pushes him to confront not only external enemies but also the very nature of his existence. This song captures his struggle, his victories, and his eventual realization that true power lies not in physical might, but in the legacy he leaves behind.</p>

King of Uruk

In the land of the river, the city so grand,
A king stands tall with a heart full of sand.
Gilgamesh rules with an iron hand,
His power unmatched, his command demands.

He towers above, his kingdom unfolds,
A hero, a tyrant, with stories untold.

King of Uruk, crown of the sky,
With strength in his veins, no man can defy.
But the gods are watching, their patience is thin,
In the heart of the city, the battle begins.

The people cry out, their voices in pain,
Yet none dare defy the king’s iron reign.
A thirst for glory, a hunger for fame,
But in the shadows, the gods know his name.

He reigns on high, the people below,
But the gods’ wrath grows, and soon it will show.

King of Uruk, crown of the sky,
With strength in his veins, no man can defy.
But the gods are watching, their patience is thin,
In the heart of the city, the battle begins.

The streets echo loud with whispers of dread,
A ruler too proud, with a heart full of lead.
The gods’ wrath awaits, the skies are aflame,
For no man is destined to rise in his name.

He reigns on high, the people below,
But the gods’ wrath grows, and soon it will show.

King of Uruk, crown of the sky,
With strength in his veins, no man can defy.
But the gods are watching, their patience is thin,
In the heart of the city, the battle begins.

A storm is brewing, the city shall fall,
The gods will bring judgment, and silence his call.
For all of his strength, he can never control,
The fate of the king, bound by a greater goal.

King of Uruk, crown of the sky,
With strength in his veins, no man can defy.
But the gods are watching, their patience is thin,
In the heart of the city, the battle begins.
