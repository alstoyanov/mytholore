    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Enkidu’s Lament" is an emotionally charged metal ballad that delves deep into the sorrow and inner conflict of Enkidu, the wild man transformed by the gods and ultimately bound to the fate of mortality. In this heartfelt song, Enkidu reflects on his life, his bond with Gilgamesh, and the weight of his own demise.</p>
<p>The track captures the intense contrast between Enkidu’s once-wild, free existence and his tragic acceptance of death. With poignant male and female vocals, "Enkidu’s Lament" expresses the raw emotion of his final moments, the pain of betrayal by the gods, and the sorrow of leaving behind a world he never truly belonged to.</p>

Enkidu's Lament

From the wilds I came, untamed and free,
A creature of earth, with no name to be.
The gods shaped my soul, but I knew not the cost,
For in man's world, so much is lost.

I walked with the wild, no chains to bind,
But in the halls of kings, I left it behind.

Enkidu’s lament, a cry through the night,
A soul that was free, now lost to the fight.
The wild heart is broken, and now it must weep,
For the world of man has stolen my sleep.

I learned of love, I learned of the fight,
With Gilgamesh, I stood side by side,
Together we challenged the gods, defied fate,
But now I see the end of my fate.

The wild man is gone, and so is my strength,
For the gods have taken me, they’ve come at length.

Enkidu’s lament, a cry through the night,
A soul that was free, now lost to the fight.
The wild heart is broken, and now it must weep,
For the world of man has stolen my sleep.

The earth calls my name, but I cannot return,
The fire in my soul, it begins to burn.
Oh, Gilgamesh, my brother, my friend,
In the end, it’s our fates that bend.

I leave this world, but my heart still fights,
A wild man’s spirit, it never dies.

Enkidu’s lament, a cry through the night,
A soul that was free, now lost to the fight.
The wild heart is broken, and now it must weep,
For the world of man has stolen my sleep.

Oh, wild spirit, you will never fade,
Your story lives on, in the hearts you've made.
The gods may take you, but you were the spark,
The wildness within, forever leaves its mark.

Enkidu’s lament, a cry through the night,
A soul that was free, now lost to the fight.
The wild heart is broken, and now it must weep,
For the world of man has stolen my sleep.
