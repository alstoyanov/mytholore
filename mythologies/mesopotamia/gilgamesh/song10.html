The Serpent's Betrayal

I found the plant, in the valley so deep,
A gift from the gods, a secret to keep.
Its power is vast, a chance to restore,
But fate has a way of closing the door.

I reached for the prize, with hope in my soul,
But the serpent’s eyes have taken their toll.

The serpent’s betrayal, a wound in my heart,
The dream of immortality torn apart.
The plant slips away, in the night’s cruel embrace,
And I stand alone in this desolate place.

I held it close, but I faltered and failed,
The serpent’s hunger was silent, it prevailed.
It struck like lightning, with venom so cold,
And the plant I sought, was taken, sold.

What price must I pay for the gods' cruel jest?
The serpent slithers, but I’m left to rest.

The serpent’s betrayal, a wound in my heart,
The dream of immortality torn apart.
The plant slips away, in the night’s cruel embrace,
And I stand alone in this desolate place.

I stare at the sky, and I feel the weight,
The gods have watched, they sealed my fate.
The plant is gone, and I am undone,
The journey was lost, the battle not won.

The path I’ve walked, a shadow now stands,
For immortality slips from my hands.

The serpent’s betrayal, a wound in my heart,
The dream of immortality torn apart.
The plant slips away, in the night’s cruel embrace,
And I stand alone in this desolate place.

The serpent’s fangs have stolen my grace,
And left me alone, in this endless space.
The gods laugh above, and I’ve lost the fight,
For the dream of forever fades into the night.

The serpent’s betrayal, a wound in my heart,
The dream of immortality torn apart.
The plant slips away, in the night’s cruel embrace,
And I stand alone in this desolate place.
