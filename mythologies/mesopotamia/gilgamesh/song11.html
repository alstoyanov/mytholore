    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"The Walls of Uruk" is a powerful metal anthem inspired by the Epic of Gilgamesh, chronicling the rise and fall of the great city of Uruk. As the mighty Gilgamesh stands tall as its ruler, he reflects on the monumental walls he built to protect his kingdom—a symbol of his ambition, pride, and immortality. But as time passes, even the strongest walls begin to crumble, and the song explores the impermanence of power, the passage of time, and the futility of trying to escape fate.</p>
<p>With a blend of intense male and female vocals, "The Walls of Uruk" combines heavy metal riffs with deep philosophical themes. The track delves into the idea that no matter how strong the barriers we build are, we can never escape the inevitable flow of time and mortality. It’s a tale of ambition, pride, and ultimately, the realization that nothing lasts forever.</p>

The Walls of Uruk

I stand on the stone, and I gaze at the sky,
The walls of Uruk, where legends never die.
Built from the earth, by the sweat of my hand,
A city of power, a kingdom to stand.

The gates rise high, the towers touch the stars,
I’ve conquered the land, and I’ve left my scars.

The walls of Uruk, strong and unyielding,
A testament to the kings who once were dreaming.
Beneath the stone, there’s a truth we all know,
No walls can protect us from the river’s flow.

The walls echo with the cries of the bold,
A fortress of might, a city of gold.
But behind every stone, there's a price to be paid,
The future is set, and the past cannot fade.

I stand here alone, though the city’s alive,
But within these walls, will my soul survive?

The walls of Uruk, strong and unyielding,
A testament to the kings who once were dreaming.
Beneath the stone, there’s a truth we all know,
No walls can protect us from the river’s flow.

I built it to last, but the years slip away,
The walls that I raised will erode with the day.
My name may endure, but time will not stop,
The kingdom will fall, and the towers will drop.

The city will fade, like the dust in the wind,
For even the mightiest walls must bend.

The walls of Uruk, strong and unyielding,
A testament to the kings who once were dreaming.
Beneath the stone, there’s a truth we all know,
No walls can protect us from the river’s flow.

Stone crumbles away, and the kings are no more,
What good are the walls when the legends are poor?
We build our defenses, but they’re bound to fall,
For no stone can save us from the gods’ cruel call.

The walls of Uruk, strong and unyielding,
A testament to the kings who once were dreaming.
Beneath the stone, there’s a truth we all know,
No walls can protect us from the river’s flow.
