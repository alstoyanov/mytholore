Ishtar's Wrath

I am the goddess, of love and of war,
I bring life, I bring death, my power is lore.
But he turned from me, rejected my gaze,
A king of the earth, unworthy of praise.

I gave him my favor, my heart and my flame,
But he spurned my grace, and now he will pay.

Ishtar’s wrath, a storm I command,
Fury unleashed with the wave of my hand.
The heavens will tremble, the earth will break,
For no man defies me and escapes his fate.

I called upon power, the Bull from the skies,
A force of destruction, to bring his demise.
With thunder and fire, he will feel my rage,
And none shall be spared, none will escape this cage.

I’ll show them my might, my fury, my wrath,
For I am Ishtar, and I carve my own path.

Ishtar’s wrath, a storm I command,
Fury unleashed with the wave of my hand.
The heavens will tremble, the earth will break,
For no man defies me and escapes his fate.

I saw him fall, yet my fury still burned,
For his defiance, my vengeance I yearned.
The gods look upon me, their voices in awe,
As my anger erupts, no one dares to draw.

Let them all know, the price they will pay,
When the goddess of vengeance comes to lay sway.

Ishtar’s wrath, a storm I command,
Fury unleashed with the wave of my hand.
The heavens will tremble, the earth will break,
For no man defies me and escapes his fate.

“No mortal will stand, no power will last,
I will burn them all, their futures are past.
My wrath is unyielding, and my power supreme,
You will know my name, you will feel my scream.”

Ishtar’s wrath, a storm I command,
Fury unleashed with the wave of my hand.
The heavens will tremble, the earth will break,
For no man defies me and escapes his fate.
