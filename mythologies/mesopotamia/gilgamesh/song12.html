    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"The Eternal City" is an evocative metal song inspired by the Epic of Gilgamesh, focusing on the rise and inevitable fall of Uruk, the great city that Gilgamesh built as a symbol of his power. The song explores the themes of ambition, pride, and the passage of time, illustrating how even the most grandiose human creations are bound to fade. Through a combination of heavy guitar riffs, male and female vocals, and haunting lyrics, "The Eternal City" emphasizes the tension between the desire for immortality and the inevitability of mortality.</p>
<p>As the city that Gilgamesh envisioned to last forever begins to crumble under the weight of time, this song reflects on the fleeting nature of human achievement and the humbling realization that no creation, no matter how mighty, can defy time’s relentless march. Fans of mythology, metal, and emotional storytelling will appreciate this journey into the heart of an ancient tale, told through powerful music.</p>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
The Eternal City

The walls rise high, as the sun kisses stone,
A kingdom of pride, where the kings once roamed.
Through the heart of the land, the river flows free,
But Uruk’s future is a shadow we cannot see.

The city stands proud, though time pulls its strings,
Every brick a story, every tower sings.

The Eternal City, built from the clay,
Where legends are born, and dreams fade away.
We built it to last, to conquer the sky,
But the hands of time will make the walls cry.

The streets are alive, yet the silence remains,
Echoes of laughter now carry in chains.
The pride of the past lies buried in dust,
The might of Uruk crumbles to rust.

Beneath the stone, the whispers call,
For even the greatest must eventually fall.

The Eternal City, built from the clay,
Where legends are born, and dreams fade away.
We built it to last, to conquer the sky,
But the hands of time will make the walls cry.

The gates stand wide, but the dream has slipped,
A king’s ambition, forever eclipsed.
The stars may shine, but their light will wane,
And the city we loved will feel only pain.

From dust to dust, we’re lost in the tide,
For even the mighty cannot hide.

The Eternal City, built from the clay,
Where legends are born, and dreams fade away.
We built it to last, to conquer the sky,
But the hands of time will make the walls cry.

We stood so tall, with hearts of fire,
But the city we built will soon expire.
The eternal dream, lost in the night,
No kingdom lasts, no matter the fight.

The Eternal City, built from the clay,
Where legends are born, and dreams fade away.
We built it to last, to conquer the sky,
But the hands of time will make the walls cry.
