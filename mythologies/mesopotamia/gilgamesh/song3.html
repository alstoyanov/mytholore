    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Battle of Uruk" is an intense metal anthem that brings to life one of the most iconic moments in Mesopotamian mythology: the fierce battle between Gilgamesh and Enkidu. The song captures the raw power and unstoppable force of two mighty beings clashing in the streets of Uruk. As the battle rages, pride and honor are tested, leading to a powerful transformation—one that forges an unbreakable bond between the two warriors.</p>
<p>In this song, Gilgamesh, the arrogant king of Uruk, faces off against Enkidu, a wild man from the forest. What begins as a battle for dominance soon turns into a legendary friendship, changing the course of their fates forever. Through thunderous riffs, fierce vocals, and anthemic choruses, "Battle of Uruk" is an exploration of power, rivalry, and the creation of a legendary bond.</p>

Battle of Uruk

In the heart of Uruk, the city of stone,
A mighty king sits upon his throne.
Gilgamesh, proud, with a heart of steel,
His strength unmatched, his will to kill.

But a challenger rises, the ground shakes with rage,
A wild force of nature, unleashed from a cage.

Battle of Uruk, the clash of the gods,
Fury and power in the name of the laws.
From the city to the plains, the fight will be won,
Two souls collide, only one can stand tall in the sun.

Enkidu, the wild, from the forest he comes,
With strength like no other, his spirit hums.
He challenges the king, their power ignites,
In the streets of Uruk, the war takes flight.

Flesh against fury, the sound of the clash,
A battle for honor, a legacy to smash.

Battle of Uruk, the clash of the gods,
Fury and power in the name of the laws.
From the city to the plains, the fight will be won,
Two souls collide, only one can stand tall in the sun.

But as the dust clears, the silence is deaf,
Two warriors stand, both breathing their breath.
The king and the wild, now bound by fate,
A friendship is forged, but it’s never too late.

Through blood and sweat, the battle is done,
Two men united, a journey begun.

Battle of Uruk, the clash of the gods,
Fury and power in the name of the laws.
From the city to the plains, the fight will be won,
Two souls collide, only one can stand tall in the sun.

“Brother, we rise, side by side,
The strength in our hearts, the power we’ll ride.
No more enemies, just friends in the fight,
Together we stand, through day and through night.”

Battle of Uruk, the clash of the gods,
Fury and power in the name of the laws.
From the city to the plains, the fight will be won,
Two souls collide, only one can stand tall in the sun.
