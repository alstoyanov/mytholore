    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Utnapishtim’s Warning" is a haunting metal ballad inspired by the Epic of Gilgamesh, exploring the somber wisdom imparted by Utnapishtim to the great king Gilgamesh. Having lived through the great flood and been granted immortality, Utnapishtim reveals the futility of seeking eternal life and warns Gilgamesh about the inevitability of death.</p>
<p>The track, with its powerful male and female vocals, carries the weight of this mythological wisdom, blending melancholic melodies with crushing metal riffs. As Utnapishtim tells of his own losses, his struggle with immortality, and the painful truth of fate, listeners are reminded of the fragile nature of life and the relentless passage of time.</p>

Utnapishtim’s Warning

I have seen the flood, the earth drowned in despair,
The gods above spoke, their wrath beyond compare.
I sailed through the storm, the heavens did roar,
And when the waters calmed, I stood on the shore.

Do you seek to escape the fate you must face?
The sands of your life cannot be erased.

Utnapishtim’s warning, a truth to be told,
The quest for immortality is foolish and cold.
The gods have decided, your fate is sealed,
There’s no escaping what the heavens revealed.

I was granted a gift, but at such a cost,
The life that I knew, forever was lost.
The gods made their choice, to test and to try,
Now I watch the world, and I only sigh.

Your heart may long for the endless night,
But even the stars fade out of sight.

Utnapishtim’s warning, a truth to be told,
The quest for immortality is foolish and cold.
The gods have decided, your fate is sealed,
There’s no escaping what the heavens revealed.

I lived through the flood, I saw the gods weep,
But nothing endures, not even the deep.
Your friend lies in death, his soul taken high,
And you, too, must face the day you will die.

The journey you seek will only bring woe,
For the path of immortality is one you should not go.

Utnapishtim’s warning, a truth to be told,
The quest for immortality is foolish and cold.
The gods have decided, your fate is sealed,
There’s no escaping what the heavens revealed.

I have walked this path, seen both birth and decay,
Time is a river, it takes all away.
In the end, all things must fall,
There’s no escaping the gods' great call.

Utnapishtim’s warning, a truth to be told,
The quest for immortality is foolish and cold.
The gods have decided, your fate is sealed,
There’s no escaping what the heavens revealed.
