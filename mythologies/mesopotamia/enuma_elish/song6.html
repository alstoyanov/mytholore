    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Call of Marduk marks the entrance of the Babylonian storm god who would become king of all gods in the Enuma Elish. Faced with chaos unleashed by Tiamat, Marduk offers salvation — but only in exchange for divine supremacy. This track is his declaration, his demand, and his divine rallying cry.</p>

Call of Marduk

The gods all tremble, lost and split
Their pride now drowns in fires lit
But I, the storm, I rise to claim
The right to tame the untamed flame

Give me the winds, the net, the spear
And crown me king if I draw near

I am the flame that eats the sky
The storm that speaks when empires die
Grant me your throne, your fate, your name
And I will break the beast of flame

The stars bend back before my roar
I crush the tide upon the shore
I do not bow, I do not bleed
I am the word the gods still need

If I descend, I rise with all
The sky shall crack and dragons fall

I am the flame that eats the sky
The storm that speaks when empires die
Grant me your throne, your fate, your name
And I will break the beast of flame

My winds are law, my voice the chain
That binds the stars, that drinks the rain
Make oath to me, or drown in dread
For only kings make monsters dead

So call my name in storm and scroll
And I will rise to take the whole

I am the flame that eats the sky
The storm that speaks when empires die
Grant me your throne, your fate, your name
And I will break the beast of flame

"I take the net of Anu’s will
The winds of fate, the fire still
By oath, by might, I rise to rule
The gods now bow — the storm is full"

"Give me your breath, and I’ll give you the dawn."
