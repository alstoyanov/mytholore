    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Order of the Flame is the final declaration of Marduk, who ascends to cosmic kingship after defeating Tiamat in the Enuma Elish. He establishes order from chaos, hangs the stars, creates time, and restructures the divine hierarchy. His reign begins not with peace, but with structure, rule, and fire.</p>

Order of the Flame

The sea is bound, the beast is still
I rise to shape the stars by will
The gods now rest beneath my hand
The sky obeys, the shadows stand

I name the winds, I cage the flame
And write the laws that none shall name

I am the fire, I am the frame
The storm enthroned in sacred flame
By blood, by bone, I set the line
The world shall turn by will — and mine

I forged the stars in Tiamat’s scream
And stretched her skin across the stream
The time now ticks in rhythm bright
For day and dark, for death and light

Let every god take place and oath
Or break beneath my woven cloth

I am the fire, I am the frame
The storm enthroned in sacred flame
By blood, by bone, I set the line
The world shall turn by will — and mine

I bound the moon to pace the tide
I crowned the sun to never hide
I raised the gates of dusk and dawn
And ordered chaos to be gone

My voice is law, my law the breath
Of life that sings in spite of death

I am the fire, I am the frame
The storm enthroned in sacred flame
By blood, by bone, I set the line
The world shall turn by will — and mine

"I place the stars in sacred gears
I call the gods to serve in tiers
The sky is sealed. The path is true.
The age of storm begins anew."

"Remember the storm
And speak my name."
