    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Voices of Clay is the awakening of humanity, created from the blood of the slain god Kingu and molded by Ea to serve the gods. In the Enuma Elish, humans are made for labor — to uphold the divine order. But in this track, they speak. They question. They remember what runs in their veins: a spark of chaos and a whisper of rebellion.</p>

Voices of Clay

We woke in dust with hands unclean
From dreams we never dared to mean
The stars were gone, the sky was blind
Our names were scribed in toil, not time

They gave us fire but kept the flame
We bear their weight, we wear their name
The gods sleep deep, their feasts endure
While we bleed life to keep them pure

They built us low with divine breath
But never freed us from their death

We are the voices made from clay
The shadows caught in light’s decay
We build, we burn, we kneel, we pray
But still we dream — we dream of day

"We are the ash of war
The chain with song
The whisper carved
Where gods went wrong."

We dig their altars, chant their names
But know their silence just the same
And in our veins, the blood still burns
The storm, the sea — the beast returns

They say we’re dust — yet dust endures
We are the blade beneath the cures

We are the voices made from clay
The shadows caught in light’s decay
We build, we burn, we kneel, we pray
But still we dream — we dream of day

"We remember
The sea
The sky
The scream."

"We were made to serve…
But not to forget."
