    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Primordial Whispers draws from the Babylonian creation myth, the Enuma Elish, and gives voice to Tiamat, the ancient saltwater goddess of chaos and creation. She was the first — mother to the gods, embodiment of the primordial sea — before Marduk rose and split her body to form the heavens and earth. This track captures her voice, her fury, and her forgotten truth.</p>

Primordial Whispers

I was before the breath of time
Before the flame, before the climb
Salt in the silence, womb of stars
I bore the gods, I bore their scars

No name, no shape, no shore defined
The void and I were intertwined

I am the sea before the storm
The dream from which all things are born
They sing, they rise, they tear, they take
But I remain in every wake

They danced upon my sleeping tide
Sowed fire deep where peace would hide
My waters wept, but they grew bold
My cradle cracked, my blood ran cold

Their voices struck, their lightning dared
But I am chaos, unprepared

I am the sea before the storm
The dream from which all things are born
They sing, they rise, they tear, they take
But I remain in every wake

They killed the deep, my silent flame
Built walls and laws and gave them names
Yet in the cracks, they feel my pull
For nothing forged escapes the null

The stillness sings beneath their screams
I hold the shape of ancient dreams

I am the sea before the storm
The dream from which all things are born
They sing, they rise, they tear, they take
But I remain in every wake

I wait beneath their sacred sky
The serpent coiled, the storm is nigh
They write their myths and paint me cruel
But I am mother — not their fool

"You fear what bore you...
But I never feared you."
