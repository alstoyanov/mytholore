    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Chains for the Dead descends into the dark ritual where Ea, architect of wisdom and fate, executes Kingu and uses his divine blood to forge humanity. According to the Enuma Elish, humans were not created as equals, but as workers — bound to labor in service of the gods. This track captures the solemnity and cruelty of creation from conquest.</p>

Chains for the Dead

The blood you spilled now seals your fate
Your veins will birth what gods create
No throne for you, no name to save
Your crown dissolved into a grave

From chains and ash, I pull the clay
A voice to serve, not speak or sway

Chains for the dead, breath for the weak
Born to obey, not to speak
From broken gods, we mold the kind
Who serve the throne and bear the bind

His eyes were stars, now dust and stone
The tablet torn, the order sown
I carve the flesh, I write the law
From cursed remains, the world shall draw

They’ll tend the rites, they’ll feed the flame
Their songs won’t rise, but serve our name

Chains for the dead, breath for the weak
Born to obey, not to speak
From broken gods, we mold the kind
Who serve the throne and bear the bind

No war in them, no storm, no sea
Just silent hands and bent decree
A thousand forms, a single fate
To build, to burn, to venerate

A god may die — but not the clay
For dust endures where stars decay

Chains for the dead, breath for the weak
Born to obey, not to speak
From broken gods, we mold the kind
Who serve the throne and bear the bind

"Kingu, whose blood once ruled the sky,
Now flows in hands that bake and die
From death we draw, from death we bind —
The soul of man, to god aligned."

"Let the dead serve. Let the dust rise."
