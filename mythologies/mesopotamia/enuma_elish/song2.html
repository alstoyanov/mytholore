    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Sweet Waters, Silent Death gives voice to Apsu, the ancient Mesopotamian god of fresh water and the first divine patriarch in the Enuma Elish. Once a peaceful, eternal presence, Apsu turns against the younger gods after their noisy chaos disrupts his order. But before he can act, he is betrayed and destroyed by his own descendant, Ea. This track is his lament, his rage, and his final moment of silence.</p>

Sweet Waters, Silent Death

They echo loud through halls of still
Born of me, yet never still
They twist the calm, defy the peace
And from my sleep they bring disease

Once I was cradle, keeper, guide
Now I drown with gods inside

I gave them water, I gave them breath
They flood my silence, I speak in death
The stream runs red, the pulse is gone
The hush I knew is overthrown

They do not fear what shaped their skin
They laugh in tongues, they burn within
Their fires dance where none should flare
So now I rise, and none I spare

Their voices crack the sacred shell
I’ll break the stream to drown the swell

I gave them water, I gave them breath
They flood my silence, I speak in death
The stream runs red, the pulse is gone
The hush I knew is overthrown

But in my slumber, they conspire
The son I nurtured draws the wire
A dagger sleeps within my well
I drift… betrayed… and drowned as well

The god of peace now dies betrayed
By hands my waters once had made

I gave them water, I gave them breath
They flood my silence, I speak in death
The stream runs red, the pulse is gone
The hush I knew is overthrown

The silence is deeper where I fall
And still they rise above it all
But every flood returns to me
In time, in dark, eventually

"Sleep takes the tide / But tides return..."
    </pre>
