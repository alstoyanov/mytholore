    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>The Killing of the Deep is the confession of Ea, the cunning god of water and wisdom, who assassinates his father Apsu in the Enuma Elish. With stealth and sorcery, he protects the younger gods from annihilation—but at the cost of divine patricide. This track captures his cold resolve and internal weight of the act.</p>

The Killing of the Deep

He stirred with hate in sacred sleep
His breath grew dark, his waters deep
We heard him whisper death and flame
So I struck first—no god shall claim

He taught me streams, he taught me stone
But he forgot—I'm not his own

I sank the deep beneath my hand
With silent art and hidden sand
His temple’s bones now build my throne
His blood still runs, but not alone

I wove the net beneath the tide
No thunder rang, no stars replied
One breath—one blade—his reign was done
I am the sea now. I am the son.

The cradle cracked, the flood obeyed
I wear the crown my father laid

I sank the deep beneath my hand
With silent art and hidden sand
His temple’s bones now build my throne
His blood still runs, but not alone

The gods rejoice, but none recall
The price I paid to see them tall
He was the stream, but I, the course
And now the tide moves by my force

The deed is done, the echo fades
Yet guilt still drinks from sacred shades

I sank the deep beneath my hand
With silent art and hidden sand
His temple’s bones now build my throne
His blood still runs, but not alone

"He closed his eyes to dream of peace
So I gave him endless sleep.
The deep is dead… and I have risen."

"Even gods must die… when they forget who watches."
