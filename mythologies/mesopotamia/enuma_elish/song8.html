When Stars Collide

I’ve taken wind and woven flame
To carve my path, to stake my claim
The net is cast, the spear is high
Let chaos choke beneath my sky!

I bore your breath, I birthed your light
Now you would tear the root from right
You wear the sun like stolen skin
But I am night, and night shall win!

Your beasts shall drown in winds I bend
My tide begins where gods will end

When stars collide and shadows scream
The throne is forged inside the dream
The storm meets sea, the sky is torn
And from their war, the world is born

Your thunder breaks like brittle shell
You’ve caged the void, but not its spell
You strike with hands I shaped in womb
But I am grave — and this, your tomb

I rise from gods who fled in fear
I am the storm that dares draw near
I bind your breath with light’s decree
And make your corpse eternity

Come, child of lies, and test your fate
The world begins when I create

When stars collide and shadows scream
The throne is forged inside the dream
The storm meets sea, the sky is torn
And from their war, the world is born

"She who bore all things
Falls beneath the flame"
"I split her heart
And made the heavens bleed."

"From my ruin, you will build.
But never forget —
You were born of death."
