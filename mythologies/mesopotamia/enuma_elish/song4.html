    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Wrath of the Dragon Queen unleashes the fury of Tiamat, the primordial goddess of saltwater and chaos, following the betrayal and death of Apsu in the Enuma Elish. Once the mother of gods, she becomes a force of divine vengeance, birthing monstrous legions and declaring war upon her own descendants. This track marks her transformation from cosmic womb to world-ending wrath.</p>

Wrath of the Dragon Queen

They broke the hush, they spilled the tide
My king lies still, the gods now hide
Their hands are red with father’s breath
I rise adorned in vengeful death

They drank my peace, now taste my storm
No child of mine shall leave transformed

I am the queen with burning wings
I birth the beasts, I curse their kings
The sky will bleed, the roots will burn
The serpent speaks — and none return

They dare to reign while I still draw
The breath that shaped the primal law
I weave the fangs, the claws, the fire
To drown their thrones in blackened mire

They crowned a son with stolen flame
But I will scorch his hollow name

I am the queen with burning wings
I birth the beasts, I curse their kings
The sky will bleed, the roots will burn
The serpent speaks — and none return

Kingu shall rise in armor red
With tablets bound to speak the dead
I carve the stars in dragon's sprawl
To crush the fools who claimed it all

I am not mother now—I’m war
Let gods remember what came before

I am the queen with burning wings
I birth the beasts, I curse their kings
The sky will bleed, the roots will burn
The serpent speaks — and none return

"Come forth, my spawn, with blood-soaked breath
Let oceans crown the gods with death
The mother sleeps no more."

"Vengeance is a sea… and I am tide."
