    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Split the Sky recounts the solemn moment in the Enuma Elish when Marduk uses the dismembered body of Tiamat to construct the cosmos. Her spine becomes the firmament, her blood the seas, her eyes the rivers. This is the act of divine creation through sacrifice, where order is quite literally stitched from chaos.</p>

Split the Sky

I stood above her shattered frame
Her blood still warm with stars and flame
No corpse — a canvas wide and raw
From broken god, I write the law

Her eyes became the rivers' weep
Her bones the mountains’ ragged keep

I split the sky with mother’s skin
I shaped the world from what had been
Each star I hung with silent breath
A monument to chaos’ death

Her tail became the trailing mist
Her breath the dawn the winds had missed
The seas still churn where she once lay
But bound in form, they must obey

The vault above, the gulf below
From spine and storm, the waters flow

I split the sky with mother’s skin
I shaped the world from what had been
Each star I hung with silent breath
A monument to chaos’ death

Her heart I sealed beneath the stone
Where gods may rule, but not alone
For every law, a wound still bleeds
From what was slain to plant our seeds

Creation groans beneath the clay
But none shall rise to strip away

I split the sky with mother’s skin
I shaped the world from what had been
Each star I hung with silent breath
A monument to chaos’ death

"With her ribs I formed the firmament
With her blood I traced the tide
The world will remember not her name
But her bones bear their sky."

"From death, I drew the line...
From her, the shape divine."
