    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Birth of a Warrior" is inspired by the legendary birth of Rostam, the greatest hero of Persian mythology. This song tells the tale of his fated arrival into the world—a moment shaped by divine intervention and destined for glory.</p>
<p>Rostam, the son of Zal and Rudabeh, was no ordinary child. From the moment of his birth, he carried the mark of a warrior. His mother, Rudabeh, suffered greatly due to his enormous size, and traditional birth was impossible. In desperation, Zal turned to the Simurgh, the mystical phoenix-like bird that had once raised him. The Simurgh revealed the secret of the first C-section, allowing Rostam to enter the world through blood and fire, a symbol of his destined path as Persia’s ultimate champion.</p>
<p>From his earliest days, Rostam was unmatched in strength and courage. Raised in the mighty lands of Zabul, he tamed the legendary warhorse Rakhsh, a beast no other man could master. This bond between warrior and steed would define his many battles, from slaying dragons to fighting demons and kings.</p>
<p>"Birth of a Warrior" captures the mythological power of Rostam’s origins—the divine forces that shaped him, the omens of his future, and the legacy of a hero who would become the lion of Persia.</p>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
Birth of a warrior

Born beneath the mountain sky, where eagles dare to roam,
A child of fate, a storm unleashed, a legend forged in stone.
The Simurgh spoke in whispered winds, its wisdom fierce and bright,
Guiding hands through shadowed fate, beneath the silver light.

Oh, the fire burns within his veins,
A titan rising, unchained!

He rides the storm, the child of war,
With thunder in his soul!
A lion’s heart, a kingdom’s sword,
The son of fate untold!

From Rudabeh’s cries of pain, the heavens shook with fear,
No mortal hands could bring him forth, till fate’s own voice drew near.
The Simurgh’s gift, a blade so sharp, tore through the walls of life,
A warrior born in blood and light, the dawn of endless strife.

Oh, the fire burns within his veins,
A titan rising, unchained!

He rides the storm, the child of war,
With thunder in his soul!
A lion’s heart, a kingdom’s sword,
The son of fate untold!

From mountain halls to battlefields, his shadow carved in time,
With Rakhsh beside, a steed of flame, they rise in war’s dark chime.
The heavens roar, the earth will shake, as destiny unfolds,
A warrior bound by fire’s embrace, his tale forever told.

Oh, the fire burns within his veins,
A titan rising, unchained!

He rides the storm, the child of war,
With thunder in his soul!
A lion’s heart, a kingdom’s sword,
The son of fate untold!

Through battles waged, through kings betrayed,
The lion’s roar remains!
A child of gods, a storm of steel,
His name will never fade!
