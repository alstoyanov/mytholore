The Love of Zal and Rudabeh’s

In the land of Kabul, beneath the sun,
A princess fair, a heart begun.
Rudabeh’s beauty like the moon's soft glow,
A love that neither time nor fate could know.
Zal, the warrior, strong and true,
With silver hair, a heart that grew.
They met across the fates’ cruel line,
Their souls entwined, a love divine.

A bond that burned through walls of stone,
In secret whispered, love unknown.

The love of Zal and Rudabeh,
A tale of hearts that will not sway.
Through mountains high and rivers deep,
Their love will conquer, and never sleep.

Their love was forbidden, the path unclear,
The walls of kingdoms, strong and near.
Zal, born of fire, and Rudabeh’s grace,
Their hearts entwined in a desperate chase.
Through the trials of fate and war they go,
To find the love that they both know.
But the gods themselves, with hearts of stone,
Would not let their love be alone.

A bond that burned through walls of stone,
In secret whispered, love unknown.

The love of Zal and Rudabeh,
A tale of hearts that will not sway.
Through mountains high and rivers deep,
Their love will conquer, and never sleep.

At last, they stood before the throne,
A love that time had never known.
With courage bright and hearts so true,
Zal and Rudabeh broke through.
Their union strong, the kingdoms bowed,
The love that spoke without a sound.
Though fate had tested, torn, and tried,
Their love stood tall, no tear denied.

A bond that burned through walls of stone,
In secret whispered, love unknown.

The love of Zal and Rudabeh,
A tale of hearts that will not sway.
Through mountains high and rivers deep,
Their love will conquer, and never sleep.

But love is not without its tears,
Zal and Rudabeh faced their fears.
The winds of fate, so cold and wide,
Tore them apart, with hearts denied.
Though love endured, the story ends,
A love so deep, it never bends.
Their names immortal, in hearts they stay,
The love of Zal and Rudabeh, forever and a day.
