    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Rostam, revered across Persia for his feats of strength and bravery, is also burdened by the curse of heroism. The more victories he wins, the more he loses. His battles bring glory, but they also come with a heavy cost—whether it’s the loss of loved ones, the toll on his body and soul, or the tragic consequences of his actions. Over time, this curse of heroism consumes him, reminding him that no hero’s journey is without a price.</p>
<p>The song echoes the internal conflict of a hero who can never escape the shadows of his past—each victory a reminder of the losses that come with it. Whether fighting monsters, kings, or tyrants, Rostam's triumphs are overshadowed by the burden they place on him. "A Hero’s Curse" is a poignant reflection on the price of destiny, the emptiness of fame, and the inevitability of fate in Persian mythology.</p>

A Hero’s curse

Upon the winds of war he rode,
A hero's strength, a tale of old.
From victory’s hands, to sorrow’s call,
The weight of fame began to fall.
He fought the beasts, he slayed the kings,
With every sword that fate did bring.
But in his heart, a hollow sound,
A hero’s soul, forever bound.

A life of glory, a life of pain,
Rostam’s heart, forever slain.

A hero’s curse, a battle won,
A journey ended, but never done.
For every victory, a price to pay,
In his soul, the shadows stay.

He sought the skies, the endless fight,
With every war, the wrongs to right.
Yet fate had carved a cruel decree,
A hero bound to tragedy.
The battles came, the blood did spill,
But each new dawn brought deeper ill.
For in his veins, the curse did rise,
A shadow cast beneath the skies.

A life of glory, a life of pain,
Rostam’s heart, forever slain.

A hero’s curse, a battle won,
A journey ended, but never done.
For every victory, a price to pay,
In his soul, the shadows stay.

At last he saw his path too clear,
The price of fame, the weight of fear.
In every step, the curse grew near,
A hero’s end, a fallen tear.
The love he lost, the blood he spilled,
The battles fought, the dreams unfulfilled.
A hero’s heart, a cursed soul,
The cost of glory, paid in toll.

A life of glory, a life of pain,
Rostam’s heart, forever slain.

A hero’s curse, a battle won,
A journey ended, but never done.
For every victory, a price to pay,
In his soul, the shadows stay.

No rest for kings, no peace for men,
The hero’s curse, it haunts again.
With every win, a deeper cost,
A warrior’s soul forever lost.

A hero’s curse, a battle won,
A journey ended, but never done.
For every victory, a price to pay,
In his soul, the shadows stay.
