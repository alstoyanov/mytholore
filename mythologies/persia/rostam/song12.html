    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
Eternal thunder

I heard the thunder, loud and clear,
The roar of a lion, nothing to fear.
He rode like fire, across the land,
With sword in hand and fate in command.
A hero born, from dust and flame,
Rostam’s name was etched in fame.
He battled beasts and kings alike,
His heart was pure, his soul a strike.

Through storm and war, through joy and tears,
The lion’s call would calm our fears.

Eternal thunder, across the skies,
Rostam’s legacy will never die.
Through blood and fire, through endless pain,
His spirit roars, again and again.

But shadows fell, a cruel disguise,
A tale of love, hidden from the skies.
His son, Sohrab, with fire in his eyes,
A warrior blind, a truth denied.
Unknowing blood, both father and son,
The battle fought, but never won.
A poisoned spear, a fatal blow,
The thunder fades, the winds now blow.

Through storm and war, through joy and tears,
The lion’s call would calm our fears.

Eternal thunder, across the skies,
Rostam’s legacy will never die.
Through blood and fire, through endless pain,
His spirit roars, again and again.

The lion falls, but still he stands,
A hero’s heart across the sands.
His name lives on, his soul takes flight,
Through endless dawn and endless night.
In every storm, in every thunder,
His spirit roars, a tale to remember.
Rostam’s legacy, forever true,
The lion’s heart forever in view.

Through storm and war, through joy and tears,
The lion’s call would calm our fears.

Eternal thunder, across the skies,
Rostam’s legacy will never die.
Through blood and fire, through endless pain,
His spirit roars, again and again.

In every storm, in every fight,
Rostam’s strength still lights the night.
Though his body falls, his spirit flies,
Eternal thunder in the skies.

Eternal thunder, across the skies,
Rostam’s legacy will never die.
Through blood and fire, through endless pain,
His spirit roars, again and again.
