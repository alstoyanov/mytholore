    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>The Shahnameh tells of how Rostam, once a man of honor and strength, is betrayed by his own allies, leading to a tragic sequence of events that ultimately shakes the foundations of his courage and trust. Betrayal enters Rostam’s life through his closest companions and those he swore loyalty to. It causes him internal conflict, grief, and, eventually, the death of those who wronged him. Despite his rage, Rostam’s path is one of sacrifice and redemption, as he battles not just enemies, but his own disillusionment. The song portrays how betrayal weaves its shadow through the life of a hero—its consequences unshakable, its scars eternal.</p>
<p>Rostam’s struggle to understand the pain of betrayal and to regain his sense of purpose resonates with anyone who has ever been hurt by those they trusted. The song asks: Can a hero ever truly be free from the shadows of the past?</p>
<p>This song explores the darker side of Rostam’s story, focusing on the emotional and psychological toll that betrayal takes on a warrior’s heart.</p>

Shadows of betrayal

In the shadow of the mountain’s peak,
A bond was born that none could seek.
Rostam, the hero, proud and true,
Trusted a friend, but fate withdrew.
A whispered word, a dagger's hand,
The treachery that none had planned.
For in the dark, a heart was sold,
The shadows grew, and all turned cold.

Betrayal's kiss upon the night,
A friendship lost, a broken light.

Shadows of betrayal, deep and dark,
A hero’s soul, now left a mark.
The lies that wound, the trust that dies,
Shadows of betrayal, where honor lies.

The winds of war, the blood that spills,
Rostam rides through ancient hills.
But in his heart, a grief unknown,
A dagger’s wound, a wound alone.
The ones he trusted turned their face,
Their lies had sealed his fate’s disgrace.
For in the night, his heart did burn,
And from the shadows, none return.

Betrayal’s kiss upon the night,
A friendship lost, a broken light.

Shadows of betrayal, deep and dark,
A hero’s soul, now left a mark.
The lies that wound, the trust that dies,
Shadows of betrayal, where honor lies.

Rostam’s sword, a gleaming flame,
To seek revenge, to find his name.
But in the shadows, something stirred,
A second chance, a whispered word.
The betrayer’s soul, a shattered thing,
He faced the wrath of Rostam’s swing.
But in the end, the lesson learned,
In shadows deep, the heart’s unturned.

Betrayal’s kiss upon the night,
A friendship lost, a broken light.

Shadows of betrayal, deep and dark,
A hero’s soul, now left a mark.
The lies that wound, the trust that dies,
Shadows of betrayal, where honor lies.

In silence now, the echo fades,
A hero’s soul, where darkness laid.
The shadows part, but still they stay,
A bitter truth that fades away.

Shadows of betrayal, deep and dark,
A hero’s soul, now left a mark.
The lies that wound, the trust that dies,
Shadows of betrayal, where honor lies.
