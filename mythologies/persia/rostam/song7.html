    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Rostam, renowned for his strength and valor, and Sohrab, a young and powerful warrior, are unaware of their relationship due to the separation of their mother, Tahmineh, and Rostam years before. As the two meet on the battlefield, they are forced into combat. They fight fiercely, with Rostam unaware that his opponent is his own blood.</p>
<p>In the climax of this tragic story, Rostam strikes Sohrab down in battle, only to realize, too late, that he has killed his own son. The pain of this realization is unbearable for Rostam, and he is left to mourn the loss of his child—his flesh and blood—caused by the very hands that gave him life.</p>
<p>This tale serves as a tragic reminder of the consequences of fate, war, and the unforeseen consequences of actions taken in the heat of battle. "Rostam and Sohrab" is not just a story of war, but a profound exploration of love, loss, and the inescapable reach of destiny.</p>

Rostam and Sohrab’s

In the shadow of the mountain’s crest,
A hero’s legacy, his heart’s unrest.
Rostam rides through lands unknown,
Unknowing that his flesh and bone,
A son awaits with fate entwined,
A warrior strong, with bloodline blind.
Sohrab’s heart, so fierce and proud,
Unaware, beneath the clouds.

A son of strength, a son of fire,
Destiny calls, but darkens higher.

Rostam and Sohrab, father and son,
A love unknown, a fate undone.
Through battle’s roar, through blood and tears,
Their story echoes through the years.

The battlefield is set for war,
Two mighty hearts, but nevermore.
Rostam faces foe with might,
But in his eyes, a hidden sight.
Sohrab stands with sword in hand,
His father’s blood, his birthright’s brand.
They clash in fury, father and son,
Unknowing of the fate undone.

A son of strength, a son of fire,
Destiny calls, but darkens higher.

Rostam and Sohrab, father and son,
A love unknown, a fate undone.
Through battle’s roar, through blood and tears,
Their story echoes through the years.

The sword strikes deep, the blood runs cold,
Rostam’s heart begins to fold.
A voice he hears, a cry of pain,
Sohrab’s name, a whispered strain.
In the silence, truth is clear,
A father’s sorrow, soaked in fear.
The son he loved, the son he killed,
Rostam’s heart, forever filled.

A son of strength, a son of fire,
Destiny calls, but darkens higher.

Rostam and Sohrab, father and son,
A love unknown, a fate undone.
Through battle’s roar, through blood and tears,
Their story echoes through the years.

A broken man, a shattered soul,
Rostam’s pain takes its toll.
The world now knows the cruel twist,
A father’s love, forever missed.

Rostam and Sohrab, father and son,
A love unknown, a fate undone.
Through battle’s roar, through blood and tears,
Their story echoes through the years.
