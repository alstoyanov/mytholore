    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"The Seven Labors" takes you through the epic trials faced by the legendary hero Rostam, as told in the ancient Persian epic, the Shahnameh. These seven trials, each more grueling than the last, are a testament to Rostam’s unmatched courage, strength, and willpower.</p>
<p>The Seven Labors:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Demon of Mazandaran: Rostam faces a demon who has taken control of the kingdom of Mazandaran, his first trial as a hero.</li>
<li>The White Demon: A terrifying demon with venomous fangs and ice-cold powers, Rostam must defeat it to free the land from its curse.</li>
<li>The Dragon of Khorasan: In the fiery pits of Khorasan, Rostam faces a monstrous dragon that terrorizes the land, and he must defeat it to protect the people.</li>
<li>The Bridge of the Dead: A deadly journey across a bridge where the souls of the lost wander, a test of Rostam’s courage and determination.</li>
<li>The Bull of Heaven: A celestial bull, born from the sky, whose rage has turned the world upside down. Rostam must subdue it with sheer strength.</li>
<li>The Demon Horse: A demonic steed with unmatched speed and fury that no one can tame. Rostam rides it into battle to prove his dominion over all beasts.</li>
<li>The Wrath of the Dragon King: The final trial—Rostam faces the mighty Dragon King, the most fearsome creature of them all. His victory over this beast cements his place as the greatest hero of Persia.</li>
</ol>
<p>These trials are not just physical challenges—they are a journey of transformation, as Rostam moves from mere mortal to legendary hero, forever etched in Persian mythology.</p>

The Seven Labors

In the dark of Mazandaran's night,
A demon’s wrath, a kingdom’s fight.
Rostam rides through blood and flame,
To break the curse and claim his name.
With sword in hand, he faces doom,
The demon’s roar shakes earth and gloom.
But Rostam’s heart is pure and bold,
He strikes the beast, its fate is told.

Through storm and shadow, through blood and fire,
He rises higher, never to tire.

Seven labors, seven trials,
Rostam's heart, a force that riles.
Through every battle, every pain,
He stands alone, through storm and strain.

A white demon with venom’s breath,
Its eyes a blaze, it reeks of death.
On frozen plains, it makes its stand,
But Rostam’s will will take command.
Through icy winds and skies of gray,
He faces death, but will not sway.
The demon falls beneath his sword,
His victory, forever roared.

Through storm and shadow, through blood and fire,
He rises higher, never to tire.

Seven labors, seven trials,
Rostam's heart, a force that riles.
Through every battle, every pain,
He stands alone, through storm and strain.

A dragon fierce with fire’s breath,
Its wings like thunder, sealing death.
It guards the land, a terror deep,
But Rostam shall not bow or weep.
He charges through the flames, unyielding,
With Rakhsh at side, the foe’s now kneeling.
The dragon falls beneath his might,
Rostam triumphs, claiming the night.

Through storm and shadow, through blood and fire,
He rises higher, never to tire.

Seven labors, seven trials,
Rostam's heart, a force that riles.
Through every battle, every pain,
He stands alone, through storm and strain.

Through seven trials, through pain and dread,
Rostam rises, his path ahead.
A hero forged in fire’s flame,
His name eternal, his heart untamed.

Seven labors, seven trials,
Rostam's heart, a force that riles.
Through every battle, every pain,
He stands alone, through storm and strain.
