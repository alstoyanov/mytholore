    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>The White Castle, a symbol of resistance against Persian rule, stands tall and fortified in the midst of a great war. Its rulers, a tribe of enemies, refuse to yield to Persia’s dominance. When Rostam is tasked with leading the siege, he does not only bring his strength but his strategic mind. The battle is intense, with every inch of the castle defended with ferocity. Rostam, however, is unstoppable. He breaks down the gates, fights valiantly through the enemy lines, and ultimately secures the victory for Persia.</p>
<p>The siege is not just a physical battle; it is a test of Rostam’s courage, leadership, and resilience in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. It shows the cost of war and the price of glory, as Rostam’s victory comes with sacrifices on both sides. The song captures not only the heroic clash but also the emotional toll of war, highlighting Rostam’s inner conflict as he emerges victorious but haunted by the cost of his triumph.</p>

The Siege of White castle

Across the land, the drums did sound,
A call to arms, a war unbound.
The White Castle, standing tall,
A fortress proud, a deadly wall.
Rostam came with fierce command,
To breach the walls, to take the land.
His army strong, his heart unbowed,
The gates of stone, beneath the cloud.

The battle roars, the arrows fly,
Rostam’s strength against the sky.

The siege of White Castle, fierce and bold,
A hero’s tale, a story told.
Through smoke and fire, through blood and stone,
Rostam fights to claim the throne.

The battle raged, the walls stood high,
With fire in his eyes, Rostam did try.
He struck the gates with might and fire,
His sword, a storm of pure desire.
The gates fell hard, the castle shook,
The enemy quivered with every look.
Rostam’s warriors stormed the keep,
Their enemies fell in bloody sleep.

The battle roars, the arrows fly,
Rostam’s strength against the sky.

The siege of White Castle, fierce and bold,
A hero’s tale, a story told.
Through smoke and fire, through blood and stone,
Rostam fights to claim the throne.

Within the walls, the fight was fierce,
The enemy’s resolve began to pierce.
Rostam’s blade struck true and deep,
Their forces shattered, their dreams did weep.
With one last charge, the castle fell,
The cries of victory rang like a bell.
Rostam stood, his victory won,
The siege complete, the battle done.

The battle roars, the arrows fly,
Rostam’s strength against the sky.

The siege of White Castle, fierce and bold,
A hero’s tale, a story told.
Through smoke and fire, through blood and stone,
Rostam fights to claim the throne.

The dust now settles, the war is won,
But in his heart, the cost was spun.
The hero stands, the battle through,
A king is made, but at what cost too?

The siege of White Castle, fierce and bold,
A hero’s tale, a story told.
Through smoke and fire, through blood and stone,
Rostam fights to claim the throne.
