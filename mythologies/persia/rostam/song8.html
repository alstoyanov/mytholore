    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>In the ancient land of Persia, Afrasiab, the ruthless king of Turkistan, launched a series of attacks against Persia, threatening to destroy everything in his path. Rostam, the mightiest warrior of Persia, answered the call to defend his people. The battle between Rostam and Afrasiab is one of the most iconic in Persian mythology, as it pits two monumental forces against each other in a struggle for the fate of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Rostam, armed with unmatched strength, wisdom, and courage, faces off with Afrasiab, a king whose heart is driven by hatred and a thirst for power. The two armies clash in a battle that shakes the heavens, with Rostam emerging victorious, killing Afrasiab and restoring peace to the land. However, the victory comes at a cost, and Rostam's soul remains troubled by the violence and loss of the war.</p>
<p>The song embodies the clash of cultures, the brutality of war, and the heroic triumph of Rostam over the evil that threatened his homeland. It explores not only the physical battle but also the emotional and moral toll of war and leadership. This tale of victory, sacrifice, and legacy has resonated throughout Persian history as a symbol of heroism and the fight for justice.</p>

The War Against Afrasiab’s

Across the deserts, far and wide,
A king named Afrasiab did ride.
His wrath was fierce, his armies vast,
A tyrant’s reign, a storm to last.
But Rostam rose, with sword in hand,
To take the fight, to free the land.
The winds of war began to call,
As Persia’s might rose to the wall.

A hero’s heart, a warrior’s flame,
Against the tyrant, he stands the same.

The war against Afrasiab, fierce and wild,
Rostam fights for the land defiled.
The clash of swords, the roar of cries,
The fate of Persia in their eyes.

Through burning sands and bloodstained plains,
The battle raged through endless pains.
Rostam’s blade, a shining light,
Against Afrasiab’s endless might.
The warlords met with fury’s roar,
Their armies clashed, their banners tore.
With every blow, a kingdom fell,
But one would rise and one would quell.

A hero’s heart, a warrior’s flame,
Against the tyrant, he stands the same.

The war against Afrasiab, fierce and wild,
Rostam fights for the land defiled.
The clash of swords, the roar of cries,
The fate of Persia in their eyes.

At last they met beneath the skies,
Afrasiab’s fear in his own eyes.
Rostam struck with strength untold,
A blow that shattered, fierce and bold.
Afrasiab fell, his reign now done,
Rostam stood beneath the sun.
The war was over, peace restored,
But in his heart, the battle roared.

A hero’s heart, a warrior’s flame,
Against the tyrant, he stands the same.

The war against Afrasiab, fierce and wild,
Rostam fights for the land defiled.
The clash of swords, the roar of cries,
The fate of Persia in their eyes.

In blood and fire, the battle ceased,
But from the war, a lasting peace.
Rostam’s name, the people sang,
A hero’s legend forever rang.

The war against Afrasiab, fierce and wild,
Rostam fights for the land defiled.
The clash of swords, the roar of cries,
The fate of Persia in their eyes.
