    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>In one of the most heartbreaking tales of Persian mythology, Rostam, the hero of Persia, is fatally struck by a spear thrown by his own son, Sohrab, whom he unknowingly fathers during a time of war. Sohrab, unaware of his lineage, fights against Rostam, believing him to be his enemy. In a cruel twist of fate, the poisoned spear fatally wounds Rostam, and it is only after his death that the truth is revealed.</p>
<p>This song captures the tragic irony of Rostam’s fall, symbolizing the inevitability of fate and the cost of heroism. The poisoned spear, the unrecognizable bond of father and son, and the fall of a legend reflect the deep, universal themes of war, sacrifice, and legacy. Despite his tragic end, Rostam’s name lives on, immortalized in the hearts of his people, a symbol of strength and honor that will never fade.</p>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
The Fall of the lion

Upon the winds of fate he rode,
A warrior strong, with a heart of gold.
The Lion of Persia, fierce and proud,
His roar shook the heavens loud.
But destiny calls with a cruel hand,
The fall of the hero, the breaking of land.
A poisoned spear, a tragic blow,
And through the night, the warrior’s woe.

A legend fades beneath the sky,
The Lion falls, and none ask why.

The fall of the Lion, a hero’s end,
The might of Persia, broken again.
Through blood and fire, through war and pain,
Rostam falls, but his name shall reign.

In the shadows, deceit was sown,
The son of the hero, never known.
A warrior blind, he struck with rage,
Unknowing that his father’s stage.
The poison deep, the spear so cold,
A death foretold, a tale so bold.
Rostam’s strength, his might and pride,
Betrayed by blood, he could not hide.

A legend fades beneath the sky,
The Lion falls, and none ask why.

The fall of the Lion, a hero’s end,
The might of Persia, broken again.
Through blood and fire, through war and pain,
Rostam falls, but his name shall reign.

The Lion roars, but not in vain,
A final breath, a final pain.
In the dark, beneath the moon,
The hero's journey ends too soon.
A fallen star, a tale untold,
The Lion’s fire, now burning cold.
Yet in the hearts of men, his soul remains,
A hero lost, but never in chains.

A legend fades beneath the sky,
The Lion falls, and none ask why.

The fall of the Lion, a hero’s end,
The might of Persia, broken again.
Through blood and fire, through war and pain,
Rostam falls, but his name shall reign.

In the land, his legend lives,
The Lion’s roar, the strength he gives.
Though death has come, his spirit soars,
Rostam’s name will shake the shores.

The fall of the Lion, a hero’s end,
The might of Persia, broken again.
Through blood and fire, through war and pain,
Rostam falls, but his name shall reign.
