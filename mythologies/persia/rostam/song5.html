The Wicked King of Mazandaran’s

In Mazandaran, where shadows reign,
A wicked king, who brings the pain.
His demons rise from depths below,
A cursed land where no light shows.
With evil hands, the king controls,
The hearts of men, the spirits’ toll.
But from the east, a hero rides,
Rostam’s blade, the king defies.

Through the darkened lands he rides,
Rostam’s courage will not hide.

The wicked king, with eyes of fire,
Shall fall to Rostam’s heart’s desire.
Through blood and darkness, he will fight,
And bring the dawn to Mazandaran’s night!

Upon the plains, the battle rages,
Rostam faces ancient sages.
With sword in hand, he cuts through light,
A hero’s fury, pure and bright.
The demons shriek, the ground shakes wild,
But Rostam stands, fierce and mild.
He strikes the heart of evil’s source,
The king will feel his wrath, of course.

Through the darkened lands he rides,
Rostam’s courage will not hide.

The wicked king, with eyes of fire,
Shall fall to Rostam’s heart’s desire.
Through blood and darkness, he will fight,
And bring the dawn to Mazandaran’s night!

The wicked king, with crown of thorns,
Feels Rostam’s wrath, his soul now torn.
His demons flee, his castle falls,
The tyrant’s reign ends with Rostam’s calls.
Rostam’s sword strikes deep and true,
The king is slain, the land renewed.
Mazandaran now breathes with light,
Rostam stands, victorious in the night.

Through the darkened lands he rides,
Rostam’s courage will not hide.

The wicked king, with eyes of fire,
Shall fall to Rostam’s heart’s desire.
Through blood and darkness, he will fight,
And bring the dawn to Mazandaran’s night!

Through the storm, through endless war,
Rostam’s legend shakes the floor.
The wicked king, the demons slain,
Rostam’s triumph will remain!

The wicked king, with eyes of fire,
Shall fall to Rostam’s heart’s desire.
Through blood and darkness, he will fight,
And bring the dawn to Mazandaran’s night!
