    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>"Rakhsh, the Steed of Thunder" brings to life the mythic bond between the legendary Persian hero Rostam and his mighty steed, Rakhsh. This song celebrates the birth and journey of Rakhsh, a horse unlike any other—fierce, untamed, and destined for greatness.</p>
<p>According to the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi, Rakhsh was no ordinary horse. Born under a mystical omen, he was chosen by Rostam, the hero who would tame him, and together they would carve their names into the annals of Persian legend. Rakhsh's bond with Rostam was forged in blood and battle, becoming an inseparable companion in countless wars, and a symbol of untamed power and loyalty.</p>
<p>From mountain peaks to the torrential battles of the battlefield, Rakhsh’s hooves were said to thunder like a storm, shaking the earth beneath him. His fury and strength were matched only by the will of his rider. Whether they faced dragons, demons, or treacherous kings, Rakhsh remained the embodiment of warrior spirit and divine destiny.</p>
<p>"Rakhsh, the Steed of Thunder" encapsulates the mythological essence of this mighty horse—a creature of lightning and fire, an eternal symbol of Persia’s strength and glory. Join us on this epic journey through time, as we honor the warrior steed that rides into battle beside the greatest hero Persia has ever known.</p>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre style="background-color: #222; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
Rakhsh, the Steed of thunder

In the valley where the winds do roar,
A stallion born of legend’s core.
With eyes of fire and hooves like flame,
Rakhsh, the mighty, shall rise to claim.
The mountains tremble, the earth does quake,
As Rostam calls, the world will break.
Through storms he runs, through blood and dust,
With Rakhsh, the warrior’s heart is thrust.

Thunder strikes as the steed takes flight,
Bound by fate, they ride through night.

Rakhsh, the steed of thunder’s roar,
Through the storm and endless war!
A legend born, a warrior’s might,
Together they’ll ignite the fight!

No other horse could bear the crown,
Rakhsh, the fire that will not drown.
With every gallop, the heavens shake,
As earth beneath him starts to break.
He treads the battlefields untold,
With hooves of fury, hearts of gold.
A beast of war, a soul of flame,
No foe will stand before his name.

Thunder strikes as the steed takes flight,
Bound by fate, they ride through night.

Rakhsh, the steed of thunder’s roar,
Through the storm and endless war!
A legend born, a warrior’s might,
Together they’ll ignite the fight!

Through rivers wide, through deserts dry,
Rakhsh gallops on beneath the sky.
No mountain too steep, no valley too deep,
With Rostam riding, they never sleep.
From the bloodied plains to the distant sea,
They fight for Persia’s destiny.
A bond unbroken, a fire untamed,
In every battle, Rakhsh is named.

Thunder strikes as the steed takes flight,
Bound by fate, they ride through night.

Rakhsh, the steed of thunder’s roar,
Through the storm and endless war!
A legend born, a warrior’s might,
Together they’ll ignite the fight!

Through the tempest, through the fire,
Rakhsh and Rostam never tire.
Their hearts are forged in battle’s flame,
Together they will carve their name.

Rakhsh… the Thunder’s Steed,
The legend’s call is free...
