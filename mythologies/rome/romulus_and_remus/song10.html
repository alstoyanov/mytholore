    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>In this sorrowful, sacred ballad, Lupa, the she-wolf who raised Romulus and Remus, speaks for the last time. She gave them life, warmth, and wildness—but watched their bond die in the name of empire. This song is her eternal lament, echoing through the ruins that forgot her name.</p>
<p>The Lupa Capitolina is a central image of Rome—depicting the she-wolf nursing the twins. In this track, she becomes a voice, a goddess-mother, mourning what Rome has become. She is the spirit of the land, the womb of wolves and kings, and the forgotten truth beneath marble and war.</p>

Lupa Capitolina

I nursed the fire in their breath
I shielded them from storm and death
Two sons beneath the wolf-god’s gaze
Now silence falls where they were raised

“Filii mei, cur cecidistis?”
(My sons, why have you fallen?)

I am the wolf who sang the dawn
But now the stars and sons are gone
I howl to gods who will not hear
The cradle is now lined with spears

He built his walls, he named his throne
But left his heart beneath the stone
The blood that feeds the empire’s rise
Still stains the ground beneath the skies

“Tuus frater, tuum cor…”
(Your brother… your heart…)

I am the wolf who sang the dawn
But now the stars and sons are gone
I howl to gods who will not hear
The cradle is now lined with spears

They called me beast, they called me sin
But I was mother, I was kin
Now Rome forgets what cannot speak
The wild, the heart, the lost, the weak

“Mater manet… lupus manet…”
(The mother remains… the wolf remains…)

I am the wolf who sang the dawn
But now the stars and sons are gone
Let marble sing and temples rise
But I will mourn beneath their lies

“Capitolina… lupa aeternam…”
(Capitolina… the eternal she-wolf…)
“Your sons are dust, your song remains…”
“You bore the gods, you mourn their names…”

I am the wolf who sang the dawn
And though the world will carry on
My lullaby is lost in stone
But I will howl until they’re home
    </pre>
