    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Romulus has chosen his path. In defiance of gods, augurs, and his own brother, he begins building Rome. This track captures the ruthless resolve of a man becoming myth—a founder willing to sacrifice blood for destiny. These walls are more than stone. They are a prophecy laid brick by brick.</p>
<p>Romulus built a wall to mark the boundaries of his city. When Remus mocked it—and leapt over—it became the final insult. Romulus killed him. Rome was born that day. The wolf god refers to Mars, their father, and the she-wolf who raised him. Romulus sees himself as the heir to both.</p>

Walls of the Wolf God

I drove my blade into the soil
And claimed the dust my birth would spoil
The gods were mute, my blood was loud
So I carved their silence into ground

“Roma oritur ex me…”
The wolf was my cradle, the wall is my crown

These are the walls of the Wolf God
Brick by oath, and blood by law
I lay the stone with Mars in mind
This is the city fate designed

The augurs fled, the stars grew dim
But still I built with godlike limb
Let cowards fear what sky might say
I build what gods will kneel to pray

“Ego sum lex, ego sum urbs…”

These are the walls of the Wolf God
Brick by oath, and blood by law
I lay the stone with Mars in mind
This is the city fate designed

My brother laughed, he crossed my gate
But I had built what shapes the state
His blood now stains the mortar red
My throne began where kinship bled

The wolf raised two—but only one
Could wear the weight of setting suns

These are the walls of the Wolf God
Brick by oath, and blood by law
Let kings bow down, let ghosts withdraw
Rome shall rise—and never fall

“Per lupum, per martem, per mortem…” 
“Let iron speak where blood is mute…”
“Let stone remember what gods forget…”
[Heavy orchestral break here—horns, slow pounding war drums]

These are the walls of the Wolf God
Born from blood, divine and flawed
By tooth and flame, my name engraved
Rome begins with those I’ve slain

His blood now stains the mortar red
My throne began where kinship bled
    </pre>
