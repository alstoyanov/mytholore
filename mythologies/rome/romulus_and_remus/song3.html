    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>This track gives a voice to Lupa, the she-wolf who found and nursed Romulus and Remus in the cave of the Palatine Hill. A divine or symbolic creature in Roman myth, she is both beast and goddess—nurturer and predator. This song is her hymn: a fierce, tribal anthem of protection and wild maternal strength.</p>
<p>After being cast into the Tiber River, the infant twins were discovered by a she-wolf. She took them into her den and fed them with her milk. In Roman myth, the she-wolf became an eternal symbol of Rome—feral, strong, and sacred. The Lupa Capitolina statue still stands as a testament to her legacy.</p>
<p>She is more than an animal. She is the Earth Mother, the wild protector, and the first force to recognize the twins’ destiny. In this track, her voice is ancient and divine. The tribal percussion mirrors the heartbeat of the land itself. She does not speak like a human—she howls with truth.</p>

She-Wolf’s Call

The forest weeps where gods forget
But I remember every breath
Two hearts, still warm, by river’s edge
Abandoned, cursed—my blood to pledge

I smelled the storm within their veins
I licked the wounds of fate and flame

I am the she-wolf in the dark
I bear the fire, I guard the spark
Your kings betray, your gods decay
But I will never turn away

The cold was death, but she was flame
Her teeth like blades, her soul untamed
She fed us life through fang and maw
We drank the blood the empire saw

No crown, no god, no throne, no law
Could match the love I saw in claw

I am the she-wolf in the dark
I bear the fire, I guard the spark
The river tried, the tyrant lied
But here beneath my ribs, you rise

Now grown in flame, they leave my den
To build a world of steel and men
But still I howl beneath the stone
My sons may rise—but not alone

I gave them fang, I gave them flame
And through their war, I speak my name

I am the she-wolf in the dark
I bear the fire, I guard the spark
Your kings betray, your gods decay
But I will never turn away

“Filii mei, surge ex nocte…”
“From fur and bone, a crown shall grow”
“They’ll carve their names in gods and stone”
“I am their shield beneath the sky”
“The wild never says goodbye…”

I am the she-wolf in the dark
I bear the fire, I guard the spark
Your kings betray, your gods decay
But I will never turn away

Two hearts once lost…
Now howl as one.
