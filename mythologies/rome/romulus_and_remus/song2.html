    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>A haunting, melancholic tribute to the silenced mother of Rome’s founders. Rhea Silvia, a vestal virgin and daughter of Numitor, was chosen to serve the gods in chastity. But fate intervened when the war god Mars descended upon her—whether by divine right or force is lost to myth. From their union came Romulus and Remus.</p>
<p>This song gives voice to Rhea’s agony: violated by divinity, imprisoned by mortals, and robbed of her children—cast into the Tiber by order of a king. Though the world remembers her sons, it forgot the woman who bore them.</p>
<p>A mortal woman caught between gods and kings. Rhea Silvia was a priestess of Vesta, goddess of the hearth, sworn to virginity. Her forced union with Mars symbolizes divine will overriding human agency. Her children’s survival sparked the founding of Rome, yet her own story is one of loss and silence. This track restores her voice through sorrow and strength.</p>

Rhea Silvia’s Lament

They bound my fate in ivory robes
A temple cage where silence grows
A virgin crowned, my will denied
But still the gods found me inside

He came not with mercy, nor with shame
A fire dressed in Mars’s name

Oh sons I bore beneath the stars
My womb, your cradle and your scar
They stole you from my trembling hands
To drown beneath the river’s sands

I dreamt of wolves with ember eyes
And cries that pierced the temple skies
You lived in blood, but died in myth
I curse the chains I once called gift

The gods are cruel, their hearts are stone
But still I pray you're not alone

Oh sons I bore beneath the stars
My womb, your cradle and your scar
They stole you from my trembling hands
To drown beneath the river’s sands

Whispered echoes in Latin (e.g., “filii mei, redite ad me…” – my sons, return to me)
Mournful string solo (violin/viola), soft piano chords, ambient sound of wind in ruins

Oh sons I bore beneath the stars
The world will know just who you are
They tried to drown the gods in mud
But you will rise through fire and blood

Your mother weeps where ruins sleep…
Forever bound… to gods and grief.
    </pre>
