    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Told from the perspective of the Tiber River itself, this track unleashes a chaotic storm of vengeance, guilt, and divine rebellion. Ordered by man to kill the twins, but compelled by fate and gods to let them live, the river becomes a symbol of suppressed fury. This is not a gentle stream—this is a god enraged.</p>
<p>The king of Alba Longa ordered the infants Romulus and Remus drowned in the Tiber. The river, however, did not kill them. Some legends say it was divine intervention—others say it was the Tiber god himself choosing to defy fate. In this track, the Tiber becomes a sentient force, haunted by the blood he did not claim.</p>

Fury of the Tiber

I am the flood, the breaker of bone
The wrath beneath the empire’s throne
The cradle and the grave in one
The blade of storms when gods are gone

They cast the twins into my soul
Their cries were stones—I lost control

I am the fury of the Tiber
A serpent carved in mud and fire
I should have drowned the blood divine
But fate runs faster than my tide

They bled their sins into my stream
I swallowed lies, I choked on screams
The king’s command was carved in stone
But I obeyed the gods alone

Their blood refused to break and sink
It clung to me, it made me think

I am the fury of the Tiber
A serpent carved in mud and fire
I should have drowned the blood divine
But fate runs faster than my tide

Now they build where I once ruled
Their thrones on silt, their swords still cruel
But I remember every breath
And I will rise to drag their death

No stone shall stand without my name
The flood forgets—but not the flame

I am the fury of the Tiber
A god betrayed, a wrathful liar
I should have dragged their bones below
But rivers learn what gods won’t know

“Currere sanguinem…” (Let the blood flow)
“Ego fui iudex…” (I was their judge)
“But mercy drowned my war…”
“And now I rise… as shore to shore.”

I am the fury of the Tiber
I drank the sky, I cracked the pyre
They think they rule the earth I feed
But I will rise again in need
    </pre>
