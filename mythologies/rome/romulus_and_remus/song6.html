    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>A slow, haunting descent into doubt, divine silence, and fraternal rivalry. Romulus and Remus, destined to found a city, turn to the gods for guidance. They perform augury—the ancient Roman practice of reading omens in the flight of birds. But the signs are unclear… and each brother claims divine favor.</p>
<p>Romulus sees twelve vultures, Remus sees six—but sees them first. The gods give no answer. The brothers argue. And from this fracture, betrayal blooms. In Roman lore, augury was central to claiming divine legitimacy. This song reflects the deep ambiguity of signs, and how silence from the gods can be just as powerful as speech.</p>

Augury and Betrayal

The vultures circle, drawn by fate
We watch the sky, we seal our hate
Twelve for me, and six for him
But he saw them first—he calls it sin

“Signa caeli, verba mortis…”

The gods are mute, the signs unclear
But I saw power in what I fear
We begged for truth from stone and flame
But silence crowned us both with shame

He mocked the throne I dared to dream
He cast his doubt on gods unseen
Each feather fell like shards of war
Each omen split our bond in four

“Numina caeca, fraus divina…”

The gods are mute, the signs unclear
But I saw power in what I fear
We begged for truth from stone and flame
But silence crowned us both with shame

You leapt the walls, you dared the line
You broke the law not yet divine
What right have you to challenge fate?
When augury sealed Rome’s gate

“Fratres in nocte, sanguis fatis…”

The gods are mute, the signs unclear
But I saw power in what I fear
We begged for truth from stone and flame
But silence crowned us both with shame

“He saw them first…”
“But I saw more…”
“Twelve wings, twelve thrones—mine by war…”
“The sky lies. The gods lie. But blood will speak…”

The gods are mute, the stars withdraw
We carved the truth with tooth and claw
No throne was ever born from peace
Only from loss, from blood’s release

“Roma… cruore nata…”
