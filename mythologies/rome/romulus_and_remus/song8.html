    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Remus speaks for the last time. This track is his emotional defiance—an anthem of rebellion not against Rome, but against what it cost. He leapt over the wall Romulus built, not to mock it, but to question the foundation of power, pride, and prophecy.</p>
<p>This is the voice of a brother who loved too deeply to submit. And it is his final cry before the blade falls.</p>
<p>In Roman lore, Remus jumped over Romulus’ wall, mocking the divine claim his brother made. Romulus killed him in response. Some versions say it was rage; others say it was ritual. But all agree—Rome began with fratricide. This track captures that moment of resistance, heartbreak, and legacy denied.</p>

Remus’ Rebellion

You built a wall to cage the sky
You crowned yourself, and let me die
A brother’s oath, a wolf’s embrace
Now lost beneath this stone-faced place

You call it fate—I call it fear
You call it Rome—but I see smear

I leapt your wall to call you out
To tear the silence from your shout
This city stands on fractured bone
And I will never call it home

I walked the path the gods ignored
You carved your throne from father’s sword
You speak of stars—I speak of blood
And warn the flood behind the flood

No augur speaks for men like me
I am the scream of prophecy

I leapt your wall to call you out
To tear the silence from your shout
This city stands on fractured bone
And I will never call it home

I didn’t want your crown or flame
I wanted both to share the name
But now I see what’s left unsaid
The wolf chose one—and left me dead

Your walls rise high, but I still stand
One breath, one strike, one shattered plan

I leapt your wall to call you out
To tear the silence from your shout
This city stands on fractured bone
And I will never call it home

“Brother, if this is Rome… let it remember me.”
“Not as the fool who mocked its rise—
But the voice it buried to build the sky.”

I leapt your wall to call you out
No sword can drown what I shout
This city rose—but not alone
It stands on me… a nameless stone

Your walls rise high, but I still stand
One breath, one strike, one shattered plan
    </pre>
