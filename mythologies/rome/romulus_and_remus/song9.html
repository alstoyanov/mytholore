    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>The blood has been spilled. Remus is dead. Romulus stands alone, surrounded by the silence of fate and the crushing weight of history. This track is his lament—his confession—as he realizes that though Rome may rise… it will do so upon the grave of the only one who could’ve ruled beside him.</p>
<p>Remus defied Romulus by leaping over the walls of his new city. Romulus struck him down. This act sealed the founding of Rome in fratricide—a theme central to its mythology and politics. The city that would conquer the world began in personal tragedy. Romulus becomes a king—but at the cost of his soul.</p>

Blood Upon the Stones

He leapt the wall, he dared my reign
But I felt thunder in my vein
The gods were silent, stars turned black
So I struck first—and can’t go back

“Brother turned, and blade was drawn…”
“Empire born, but love is gone…”

There is blood upon the stones
And the wind forgets his name
Rome will rise—but I’m alone
The crown is forged in shame

His eyes held fire until the end
No sword could kill a greater friend
But walls demand a sacred cost
And I must rule what we have lost

“One shall build, the other fall…”
“A wolf can’t love what feeds them all…”

There is blood upon the stones
And the wolves retreat in pain
Rome shall rise—but not atone
For the line that broke in flame

I did not weep. I could not speak.
The crown was warm, the blade was weak
But in the silence, I still hear
His voice, not rage—but love and fear

“The gods will build upon this grave…”
“But never give what you forgave…”

There is blood upon the stones
And Rome begins in curse
I wear the name, I bear the throne
But I will never lift the hearse

“Remus… frater… mortuus…”
(Remus… brother… dead…)
“Ex sanguine, regnum…”
(From blood, a kingdom)
“Sed numquam pax…”
(But never peace…)

There is blood upon the stones
And the wolves no longer sing
Let Rome be carved from ash and bone
I killed my brother to crown a king
    </pre>
