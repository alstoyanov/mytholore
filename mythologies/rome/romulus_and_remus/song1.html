    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>This epic metal anthem opens the story of Romulus and Remus, twin sons of Mars—the Roman god of war—and the mortal vestal virgin Rhea Silvia. Sung from the perspective of one of the twins, the track recounts their legendary survival after being condemned to death as infants. Thrown into the Tiber River by order of a jealous king, they were expected to perish… but fate, fire, and blood said otherwise.</p>
<p>Romulus and Remus were born in defiance of divine and royal law. Their mother, Rhea Silvia, was a vestal virgin—sworn to chastity—but was seduced (or ravaged, depending on the source) by Mars, god of war. Their existence threatened King Amulius, who ordered them cast into the Tiber. The river, however, did not claim them. Instead, they were saved by a she-wolf (lupa), who nurtured them—setting them on a path to greatness and eventual tragedy.</p>
<p>Mars is the Roman god of war, father of Romulus and Remus. Unlike his Greek counterpart Ares, who was often portrayed as chaotic and disliked, Mars was deeply revered in Roman culture—not only as a god of battle but also as a protector of Rome. He represents disciplined warfare, honor, and the divine right to conquer. In this track, his legacy burns in his sons’ veins as they rise from near-death to challenge the world.</p>

Bastards of the Tiber

Born of blood, not meant to breathe
A god’s desire, a mortal’s grief
Torn from the womb of a cursed decree
Dragged to the river, the silence calls me

But I feel fire in my veins
Not even death will know my name

We are the bastards of the Tiber
Marked by gods, drowned by liars
But the current cannot claim my crown
I rise where empires burn down

Chains of fate rust in the flood
The tyrant's will is etched in mud
Abandoned sons with wolf-born breath
We claw through shadows, we spit on death

The stars above, they scream our claim
In every howl, I hear my name

We are the bastards of the Tiber
Marked by gods, drowned by liars
But the current cannot claim my crown
I rise where empires burn down

From the riverbed, we forge our steel
In dreams of fire, we start to heal
The bloodline black, the curse runs deep
But vengeance guards the dreams I keep

You tried to bury a legacy
But storms don’t drown divinity
Your throne was built on brittle stone
Now I will carve my name in bone

We are the bastards of the Tiber
Sons of wolves, born from fire
The flood refused to wash us down
Now hear us rise and take the crown

Born to die…
But I live to rule.
I live to rule.
    </pre>
