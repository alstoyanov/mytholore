    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>This is the anthem of Romulus and Remus as warrior-brothers—the sons of Mars and wolves, raised by shepherds, hardened by chaos. Before the betrayal, before the bloodshed, they were united. Together they fought bandits, tyrants, and the fate that hunted them from birth.</p>
<p>This track is their battle cry: primal, noble, brutal. It captures their strength and their bond—one forged in flame and war.</p>
<p>After growing up unaware of their divine blood, Romulus and Remus became fierce warriors. They fought to restore their grandfather Numitor’s throne and led raids across the region. This track channels their legendary courage and fearlessness—the moment before destiny tears them apart.</p>

Brothers of the Blade

Raised by wolves and mortal hands
We carved our names in rebel sands
No crown, no chain, no god decreed
Could stop the blood we swore to bleed

We were born with fire in our fists
And vengeance burning in our myths

We are the brothers of the blade
Born from darkness, unafraid
Back to back, through fire and flame
We fight, we kill, we earn our name

Through bandit’s fire and tyrant’s reign
We broke their backs, we snapped their chains
The world would see us torn apart
But we were legion from the start

Steel to steel, our hearts align
Two sons of ash, of war, of time

We are the brothers of the blade
Born from darkness, unafraid
Back to back, through fire and flame
We fight, we kill, we earn our name

We dreamt of cities, thrones of stone
Of building realms we’d call our own
But dreams are fragile things to hold
When blood runs hot and gods grow cold

The storm still sleeps within our veins
But brotherhood was forged in chains

We are the brothers of the blade
Born from darkness, unafraid
Back to back, through fire and flame
We fight, we kill, we earn our name

“Strike for the past, strike for the blood”
“Strike for the wolf who raised us up”
“Strike for the fire they tried to drown”
“We rise—we rise—we burn it down!”

We are the brothers of the blade
Born from nothing, war remade
Bound by fate and blade and flame
We fight, we kill—we earn our name

The storm still sleeps within our veins
But brotherhood was forged in chains.
