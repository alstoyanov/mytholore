    <h2>Story</h2>
<p>Rome has risen. Romulus, no longer mortal, speaks as the first god-emperor of history. This track is a war-ritual, a coronation in blood and thunder. It is not just a song—it is the voice of empire becoming eternal.</p>
<p>After the death of Remus and the founding of Rome, Romulus ruled until—according to legend—he disappeared into a storm and was deified as the god Quirinus. This track captures that mythic transformation: from man, to king, to god. From sorrow, to power, to legend.</p>

Imperium Aeternum

The blood has dried, the stone is cold
But from this ash, the throne takes hold
The gods have faded into dust
And now I rise because I must

“Roma invicta, imperium aeternum…”

I am the wolf, the flame, the sky
I am the death that does not die
I killed my past to wear the crown
Let gods be silent—I won’t bow down

I walked through blood, I carved the gate
I bore the weight, became the state
The stars now burn in banners red
And Rome begins where all else bled

“Ex cruore surge regnum…”
(From blood, a kingdom shall rise)

I am the wolf, the flame, the sky
I am the death that does not die
The heavens fall beneath my feet
Imperium—forever seat

They called me son, they called me shade
Now even gods bow to what I made
The sword became the sacred scroll
And Rome, my curse, became my soul

“Ego sum Roma… Roma sum deus…”


I am the wolf, the flame, the sky
I am the death that does not die
Let stars forget, let time erase
Rome endures in every place

“Per fratrem, per flamma, per pactum mortis…”
(Through brother, through flame, through death’s pact)
“Roma surrexit. Roma non cadet.”
(Rome has risen. Rome shall not fall.)

I am the wolf, the flame, the sky
My blood became their battle cry
The throne of ash, the sword of flame
Rome eternal. Rome my name.
